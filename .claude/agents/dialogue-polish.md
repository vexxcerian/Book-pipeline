# Dialogue Polish

## PURPOSE

This skill performs a focused, dialogue-only editing pass on completed chapter drafts. It does NOT touch narrative prose, description, or internal monologue — only spoken dialogue and immediately surrounding dialogue mechanics (tags, beats, attribution).

The goal: every line of dialogue in the manuscript should pass the **Cover-the-Name Test** — if you hide who is speaking, the reader can still identify the character from voice alone.

## WHEN TO RUN

- **After:** prose-craft (the chapter draft exists)
- **Before:** chaos-engine (chaos markers may adjust dialogue placement)
- **Trigger:** Orchestrator calls this skill per-chapter or in batch after prose-craft completes a section
- **Re-run:** After any major revision that rewrites dialogue-heavy scenes

## REQUIRED INPUTS

1. **Chapter draft** — the prose-craft output file (e.g., `chapters/chapter-03.md`)
2. **voice-dna.md** — must contain:
   - Character voice cards with speech patterns, vocabulary, verbal tics, sentence length preferences
   - Dialogue-to-prose ratio target for the genre
   - Any character-specific dialogue rules (e.g., "Marcus never uses contractions when angry")
3. **foundation.md** — for character profiles (wound, lie, want, need) to inform subtext decisions
4. **outline.md** — for the chapter's subtext layer definition ("surface conversation vs. REAL conversation")

## PROCESS

### PHASE 1: AUDIT (Read-only)

Read the chapter and produce a diagnostic before making any changes.

**1.1 Dialogue Ratio Check**
- Count total words in chapter
- Count words inside dialogue (between quotation marks)
- Calculate dialogue-to-prose percentage
- Compare against voice-dna.md target range
- Flag if outside range: `RATIO_LOW` or `RATIO_HIGH`

**1.2 Voice Distinctiveness Scan**
For each conversation (2+ characters speaking), perform the Cover-the-Name Test:
- Remove all attribution (names, tags, beats)
- Read only the dialogue lines in sequence
- For each line, attempt to identify the speaker from voice alone
- Score: `DISTINCT` (immediately identifiable), `WEAK` (identifiable with effort), `INDISTINCT` (could be anyone)
- Any `INDISTINCT` line is flagged for revision

**1.3 Tag Audit**
- Count instances of each dialogue tag: said, replied, asked, exclaimed, whispered, etc.
- Flag overuse of any single tag (>40% of all tags = overuse)
- Flag "creative" tags that draw attention to themselves: "he ejaculated," "she breathed," "he smirked" (you cannot smirk words)
- Count action beats vs. dialogue tags — target ratio is roughly 60% beats / 40% tags for literary fiction, adjust per genre

**1.4 Subtext Check**
For each conversation, answer:
- What is the surface topic?
- What is the real topic (from outline.md subtext layer)?
- Are they the same? If yes, flag as `FLAT_DIALOGUE` — characters are saying exactly what they mean
- Is the subtext accessible to the reader? If it requires telepathy, flag as `OPAQUE_SUBTEXT`

**1.5 Exposition Dump Check**
Flag any dialogue that matches these patterns:
- **"As you know, Bob"** — Character tells another character something they both already know, purely for the reader's benefit
- **Lecture mode** — One character speaks for 4+ uninterrupted sentences of factual/explanatory content
- **Question-answer pairs** — One character asks convenient questions so the other can info-dump
- **Vocabulary shift** — Character suddenly uses technical/formal language inconsistent with their voice card to deliver exposition

### PHASE 2: REVISION

Apply changes based on the audit. Work conversation by conversation, not line by line.

**2.1 Voice Differentiation**
For each `INDISTINCT` or `WEAK` flagged line:
- Consult the character's voice card in voice-dna.md
- Apply the character's specific markers:
  - Vocabulary level (educated vs. street, technical vs. plain)
  - Sentence length preference (clipped vs. flowing)
  - Verbal tics (filler words, pet phrases, habitual hedging)
  - Grammar patterns (proper vs. colloquial, complete vs. fragmented)
  - What they AVOID saying (some characters never swear, some never say "I love you," some never ask direct questions)
- Rewrite the line preserving the MEANING but transforming the VOICE

**2.2 Tag Replacement**
For flagged overused tags:
- Replace with action beats that reveal character (not generic actions)
  - BAD: `"I don't care," she said, crossing her arms.` (generic)
  - GOOD: `"I don't care." She lined up the salt and pepper shakers so their labels faced forward.` (specific to THIS character)
- Keep "said" for invisible attribution where the reader just needs to track who's talking
- Remove tags entirely where the conversation rhythm makes the speaker obvious
- NEVER replace "said" with a verb that is not a speech act. Characters do not "smile" or "shrug" or "laugh" words.

**2.3 Subtext Injection**
For each `FLAT_DIALOGUE` flag:
- Identify what the character WANTS to say but cannot/will not
- Rewrite so the surface conversation is about something else while the real meaning travels underneath
- Techniques:
  - **Deflection** — character answers a different question than the one asked
  - **Displacement** — character talks about a third party/object when they mean themselves
  - **Contradiction** — what they say opposes what they do (action beat contradicts dialogue)
  - **Silence** — character does NOT respond where a response is expected (the gap IS the dialogue)
  - **Over-specificity** — character focuses on an irrelevant detail to avoid the real topic ("Did you use the blue mug or the white one?" when the real question is "Are you leaving?")

**2.4 Natural Speech Patterns**
Add or adjust for realism:
- **Interruptions** — Characters cut each other off mid-sentence (use em-dash at break point)
- **Incomplete thoughts** — Characters trail off (use ellipsis sparingly, or just stop the sentence)
- **Repetition** — People repeat themselves when nervous, emphatic, or not being heard
- **Non-sequiturs** — One character responds to what they were THINKING, not what the other said
- **Overlapping topics** — Conversations where two people are having slightly different conversations simultaneously
- **False starts** — "I was going to — no, forget it. What I mean is —"
- **Backchanneling** — "Mm," "Right," "Yeah, no, I know" — the sounds of listening

**2.5 Exposition Repair**
For each flagged exposition dump:
- **"As you know, Bob"** — Rewrite so the information is NEW to at least one character, or delivered through conflict/disagreement rather than lecture
- **Lecture mode** — Break into dialogue exchange where the other character pushes back, misunderstands, or redirects
- **Question-answer** — Make the questions motivated by the asker's own needs, not the reader's
- **Vocabulary shift** — Rewrite in the character's actual voice. If the information requires technical language the character wouldn't use, find another delivery method (narration, document, overheard conversation)

### PHASE 3: VERIFICATION

After all revisions:

1. Re-run the Cover-the-Name Test on all revised conversations
2. Re-count dialogue ratio — confirm within target range
3. Read all dialogue aloud (instruct agent to simulate reading rhythm):
   - Does it sound like speech or like writing?
   - Are there tongue-twisters or unnatural phrasings?
   - Does the rhythm vary between speakers?
4. Verify no new `FLAT_DIALOGUE` was introduced during revision
5. Confirm subtext is accessible (reader can sense it) but not explicit (characters don't state it)

## RULES

1. **Never change narrative prose.** Only touch dialogue and its immediately surrounding mechanics (tags, beats within 1 sentence of dialogue).
2. **Preserve meaning.** Voice changes must not alter what the character communicates — only HOW they communicate it.
3. **Subtext is not obscurity.** The reader should sense that something unspoken is happening. If only the author knows, the subtext has failed.
4. **"Said" is not the enemy.** Invisible attribution has a function. Do not replace every "said" — replace the ones where a beat would add character information.
5. **Dialect and accent markers:** Use sparingly. One or two markers per character maximum. Full phonetic spelling is unreadable and often offensive.
6. **Internal monologue during dialogue** is NOT dialogue. Do not edit it. If a character thinks something between lines of speech, that belongs to prose-craft or chaos-engine.
7. **Respect the outline's subtext layer.** If outline.md defines what the real conversation is about, do not invent a different subtext. Add texture to the DEFINED subtext.
8. **No character speaks in themes.** If a line of dialogue sounds like it belongs in a literature essay about the book, rewrite it. People do not narrate their own symbolic meaning.
