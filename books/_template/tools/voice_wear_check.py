voice_wear_check.py — whole-book voice-wear gate, PER CHARACTER (every POV).

Deep single-POV writing wears when a character's signature kit repeats at the
same rate chapter after chapter: the signature calcifies into a tic (an AI
fingerprint + reader skim). This tool measures that for EVERY POV in the book,
not a hardcoded few. It has three layers:

  1. BOOK-WIDE RETIRED phrases (hard gate) — pipeline tics that leak across all
     POVs + narration (e.g. "never once"). Any occurrence anywhere FAILS.

  2. Auto-detected self-repetition (per character, no hardcoding) — for each POV
     it gathers that character's chapters and finds multi-word phrases the POV
     repeats across its own chapters. Works for any POV character and any future
     POV the moment they appear in feedback/pov-map.txt (one "chapter-N: Name"
     line per chapter; single-POV books can skip the file entirely).
     This is the universal engine — every character is covered automatically.

  3. Named-device caps (optional, per character) — hand-tuned regexes with a
     per-chapter cap for signatures a human curated in voice-dna §4b / the
     per-POV ledgers. Add a character here and it's enforced; omit them and the
     auto-detector (layer 2) still covers them.

Run as part of the post-completion check for the whole book:
    python3 tools/voice_wear_check.py
Exit code is non-zero if any RETIRED phrase appears or any named-device cap is
exceeded. Layer-2 self-repetition prints as WARN (targeting aid — always read
the phrase in context before cutting; some repeats are deliberate motifs).
