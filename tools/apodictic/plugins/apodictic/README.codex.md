# APODICTIC Development Editor

Developmental editing that listens before diagnosing.

AI-powered developmental editing framework for fiction, narrative nonfiction, and persuasive/argument-shaped nonfiction (policy briefs, op-eds, testimony — via the Nonfiction Argument Engine). Diagnoses structural issues in manuscripts through systematic passes, genre-calibrated analysis, and specialized audits.

## Installation

The current tested Codex install path is workspace-based:

1. From the repo root, run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-codex.mjs
   ```
2. Open the generated `codex/` folder as your Codex workspace root.
3. In Codex, open the Plugins view and install `APODICTIC` from the local marketplace.
4. Start a fresh thread and run `apodictic-start`.

If the plugin does not appear, make sure Codex is opened on the generated `codex/` directory, not the repo root.

## Quick Start In Codex

If you're new to the plugin, start with a plain-language request:

- "Use APODICTIC to tell me what kind of manuscript help I need."
- "Use APODICTIC to diagnose the structural problems in this draft."
- "Use APODICTIC to help me plan revisions without rewriting prose."

If you already know the entrypoint you want, invoke the namespaced workflow directly:

- `apodictic-start`
- `apodictic-audit shelf`
- `apodictic-coach`

The plugin is designed to feel natural in chat, so plain-language requests and named `apodictic-*` entrypoints should both work.

## What It Does

The Development Editor works like a human developmental editor: it reads a manuscript, infers what it's trying to do, and diagnoses where it succeeds or struggles. The system listens first — inferring authorial intent from the text — before measuring the work against that intent.

**Key design principle:** The editor predicts the manuscript's contract (genre, reader promise, controlling idea) from the text alone. Misalignments between the inferred contract and the author's stated intent are diagnostically valuable — they reveal where the text doesn't communicate what the author intended.

**The Firewall:** The system diagnoses problems and identifies classes of solution. It never invents content (new plot events, characters, dialogue, imagery). The author creates; the system analyzes.

## What This Plugin Does and Does Not Do

**It does:**
- Diagnose structural problems in fiction and narrative nonfiction manuscripts
- Identify where a manuscript succeeds or struggles relative to its own implied contract (genre, reader promise, controlling idea)
- Provide genre-calibrated analysis across literary fiction, horror, mystery, thriller, science fiction, fantasy, romance, and cross-genre hybrids
- Track continuity, pacing, character arcs, reveal economy, emotional dynamics, and thematic coherence across 11 systematic passes
- Run specialized audits for specific craft concerns (scene function, shelf positioning, AI-prose detection, worldbuilding integration, force delivery, and more)
- Diagnose argument-shaped nonfiction with the **Nonfiction Argument Engine** — argument spine, support, and warrant, plus Red-Team, Persuasion, and Evidence companions
- Maintain a **Legal Risk Register** that flags possible defamation, privacy, and rights exposure for a lawyer's review — it flags, never adjudicates, and is never legal advice
- **Triage feedback** and build a **beta-reader instrument** — sort and prioritize beta-reader/editor notes, and turn a diagnosis into targeted reader questions
- Render **manuscript-structure visualizations** and offer **Diagnostic-Vocabulary** and **Editor-Scaffolding** operator modes
- Keep projects addressable and resumable (`apodictic-projects`, state-driven resume), including **Retcon Planning** and **State Cards**
- Generate editorial letters, revision checklists, and diagnostic state that persists across revision rounds
- Guide pre-draft writers from idea to draftable structure

**It does not:**
- Rewrite prose, generate new scenes, invent characters, or produce creative content (the Firewall)
- Line edit, copyedit, or proofread
- Replace a human developmental editor's judgment — it provides analytical scaffolding, not verdicts
- Guarantee commercial viability, publication readiness, or literary merit
- Add telemetry or network calls of its own — the plugin transmits nothing on its own, and stores diagnostic state only on your local disk; the optional `apodictic-research` modes make web searches you invoke explicitly

The system diagnoses structure. The author creates content. After diagnosis, you can either stay inside APODICTIC's coaching/editor workflows or switch to a general writing session outside the diagnostic firewall.

## Intended Audience

**Primary audience:** Fiction writers working on novels, novellas, and story collections. The plugin also supports narrative nonfiction, memoir, and creative nonfiction with genre-appropriate calibrations. Writers of persuasive, argument-shaped nonfiction — policy briefs, op-eds, and testimony — are a real audience too: the revision-coaching layer triggers on those forms and the Nonfiction Argument Engine diagnoses their argument structure.

**Secondary audience:** Human developmental editors seeking analytical scaffolding, and writing groups using diagnostic vocabulary for structured feedback.

The plugin assumes its user is an adult working on a creative project. Its outputs are structural diagnoses, editorial letters, and revision recommendations — analytical documents, not fiction.

## Components

### Workflows

- **Development Edit** — The main workflow: intake protocol, 11 analysis passes, synthesis, revision rounds, genre calibration
- **Pre-Writing Pathway** — Guides writers from idea to draftable structure (no manuscript required). Writer mode calibration, seed inventory, readiness gates, option architecture, complexity budget, prospective contract, re-entry diff protocol.
- **Plot Coaching** — Plot structure diagnosis (50 spines across 12 families), selection coaching, fantasy & series architecture
- **Specialized Audits** — 37 available audits (3 universal, 19 craft, 10 genre, 5 tag), including 3 primary tags (cozy, philosophical, erotic content) and 2 companion intimacy audits; plus 6 internet-enabled research modes
- **Nonfiction Argument Engine** — Diagnoses argument-shaped nonfiction: argument spine, support, and warrant, with Red-Team, Persuasion, and Evidence companions
- **Legal Risk Register** — Flags possible defamation, privacy, and rights exposure for counsel to review. It flags, never adjudicates — not legal advice
- **Feedback Triage & Beta-Reader Instrument** — Sort, cluster, and prioritize beta-reader/editor feedback, and turn a diagnosis into targeted beta-reader questions
- **Projects** — Addressable, resumable editing projects (`apodictic-projects`, state-driven resume), with Retcon Planning and State Cards
- **Revision Coaching** — Post-diagnostic coaching: session planning, stuck-point help, momentum tracking, deadline management
- **Manuscript-structure visualizations** and **Diagnostic-Vocabulary / Editor-Scaffolding** operator modes

### Entrypoints

In this Codex build, the legacy workflows are exposed as namespaced compatibility skills. Invoke them by name or by plain-language request.

**Start here:**
- `apodictic-start` — I have a manuscript — what should I do with it?
- `apodictic-index` — What can this plugin do? Where do I start?

**Diagnostic workflows:**
- `apodictic-ready` — Is this ready to submit?

**Focused tools:**
- `apodictic-audit` — Run a specific deep-dive analysis.
- `apodictic-research` — I need internet-assisted verification.
- `apodictic-coach` — I have a diagnosis — how do I revise?
- `apodictic-plot-coach` — Is my plot structure working?
- `apodictic-legal-risk` — Flag legal exposure (defamation, privacy, rights) for a lawyer's review.
- `apodictic-triage-feedback` — Sort and prioritize beta-reader / editor feedback.
- `apodictic-reader-questions` — Turn my diagnosis into targeted beta-reader questions.

**Setup:**
- `apodictic-pre-writing` — I have an idea but no manuscript yet.
- `apodictic-new-project` — Set up a new editing project.
- `apodictic-projects` — List, resume, and tidy my editing projects.

### Selection Guide

- See `AUDIT_SELECTION_MATRIX.md` for a practical routing chart of core passes, full passes, Pass 11 sub-passes, specialized audits, tag audits, and research modes.
- See `overview-dashboard.html` for a visual map of workflows, pass blocks, and audit families.
- See `project-dashboard.html` for an at-a-glance **snapshot** of your projects — paste the registry payload `apodictic-projects` produces and see where each project stands on the lifecycle rail plus its launch command. Render-only (a viewer/launcher, not a live monitor).

## Usage

### Getting Started
```
apodictic-start
```
The intake router asks what you have (idea, fragments, partial draft, complete draft, series), what you need (draft, diagnose/fix, submission readiness, AI cleanup), and any modifiers (deadline, AI-assisted text, nonfiction, editing for someone else, co-authoring). Routes you to the right workflow automatically. All other namespaced entrypoints remain available as direct shortcuts.

### Full Development Edit
```
apodictic-start path/to/manuscript.md
```
Answer "complete draft" + "diagnose/fix" and the router runs intake, core passes (reverse outline, reader experience, structural mapping, character audit, reveal economy), and synthesis. Outputs an editorial letter, revision checklist, and diagnostic state.

### Submission Readiness
```
apodictic-ready
```
The full "is this ready?" workflow. Runs Core DE → Synthesis → Pass 11 → Compression Test and produces a unified readiness assessment with verdict, market reality check, opening conversion gate, SR code inventory, and query/synopsis diagnostic. For deadline-constrained writers, say "I'm on a deadline" during intake to get Submission Triage (single-pass go/no-go) instead.

### Quick Diagnosis
```
apodictic-start
# then answer: diagnose/fix → name one concern, e.g. "pacing in Act II"
```
A focused check on that one concern, without the full pass sequence.

### Pre-Writing Pathway
```
apodictic-pre-writing
```
For writers with an idea but no manuscript. Calibrates writer mode (architecture-first vs. discovery-first), inventories seeds, builds a protagonist engine, offers 2–3 structural candidates, sets complexity caps, and produces a Structural Plan or Minimal Viable Plan. When the writer returns with a draft, the Re-Entry Diff Protocol compares intent against execution.

### Plot Coaching
```
apodictic-plot-coach
```
Helps choose or fix a plot structure. Works for pre-drafting planning, stuck drafts, and structural pivots.

### Specialized Audit
```
apodictic-audit character
apodictic-audit shelf
apodictic-audit
```
Run a named audit or list all 37 available audits.

### Research Mode
```
apodictic-research comp
apodictic-research fact-check
```
Internet-enabled research to validate comps, check facts, verify genre currency, or surface representation context.

## Execution Modes

APODICTIC selects its execution mode based on the available context window. On large-context frontier models, the default is **single-agent mode**: one subagent runs all passes sequentially in a single context, with the full manuscript in view throughout. This is the fastest and most token-efficient option, viable for manuscripts up to roughly 200,000 words.

For a **final-round verification pass**, request **swarm mode**: each pass runs as an independent subagent loading the full manuscript. The gain is **architectural isolation** — each pass genuinely cannot see prior analysis until reconciliation, which eliminates anchoring bias — at approximately **5x the token cost**. Best reserved for final submission prep: an earlier validation reported ~2× findings, but a 2026-06 N=1 re-test on long fiction did not reproduce a depth advantage, so swarm's dependable value is verification isolation, not everyday yield.

On standard-context models, APODICTIC falls back to per-pass subagent dispatch with three tiers: **sequential** (each pass gets the full manuscript), **hybrid** (later passes get targeted excerpts via a focus map, ~2–3x cost), and **swarm** (parallel independent subagents, ~5x cost).

**When to consider each mode:**

- **Single-agent** (default on large-context models): Most manuscripts, quick diagnostics, budget-constrained runs.
- **Swarm**: Final-round diagnostics before submission, or when prior runs produced findings that echo rather than complicate each other.
- **Sequential / Hybrid**: Automatic on standard-context models; not typically needed on large-context models unless you prefer per-pass isolation.

To invoke swarm: tell the editor "run this in swarm mode" at intake.

## Model Requirements

APODICTIC works best on high-capability models with strong instruction-following and enough context to hold large manuscript sections in memory. On weaker or smaller-context models, expect degraded severity honesty, thematic interpretation, deliberate ambiguity handling, and fix quality. If you're evaluating the framework, use the best model available in your Codex environment.
