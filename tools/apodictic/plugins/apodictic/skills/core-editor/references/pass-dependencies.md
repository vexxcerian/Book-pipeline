# Pass Dependencies, Query Resolution & Audit Resolution

**Status:** Implementation-ready
**For:** APODICTIC Development Editor v0.6
**Last updated:** 2026-02-23

This file is loaded at runtime when the query-driven pass architecture is active. It replaces the fixed Core DE / Full DE tier model with concern-driven resolution.

## §1. Pass Dependency Map

### Tier 1 — Read (no dependencies, parallel-capable)

| Pass | Name | Depends on | Output artifact |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Reverse Outline | manuscript only | `[Project]_Pass0_Reverse_Outline_[runlabel].md` |
| 1 | Reader Experience | manuscript only | `[Project]_Pass1_Reader_Experience_[runlabel].md` |
| 10 | Entity Tracking + Timeline Architecture | manuscript only | Run-folder: `[Project]_Pass10_Entity_Tracking_[runlabel].md` (Rule Ledger + Entity Table + legacy chronology). Project-level rolling: `Timeline.md` at project root (8-section schema per `references/pass-10.md`). |

Tier 1 passes read the manuscript directly. They have no upstream dependencies and can execute in parallel.

**Pass 10 — Pass-10-Class artifact.** Pass 10 produces both a run-folder-scoped artifact (existing Entity Tracking output) and a project-level rolling artifact (`Timeline.md`). The Timeline artifact is the first live instance of the Pass-10-Class Rolling Structured Artifacts pattern named in `core-editor/SKILL.md §Project Integration` (alongside `Diagnostic_State.md`, `SYNTHESIS.md`, `Argument_State.md`, `Series_State.md`). Schema lives in `references/pass-10.md`. Three mechanical validators pair with the Timeline artifact: `validate.sh timeline-diff`, `validate.sh timeline-arithmetic`, `validate.sh timeline-anchor-conflict`. Inconsistency Ledger counts feed synthesis-layer severity per the Canonical Audit-Signal Propagation Rule (`run-synthesis.md §Step 2`).

### Tier 2 — Analyze (each depends on ≥1 Tier 1 pass)

| Pass | Name | Depends on | Output artifact |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2 | Structural Mapping | 0 | `[Project]_Pass2_Structural_Mapping_[runlabel].md` (on-page act/movement boundaries, beat presence, structural causality, orphan scenes; for spine-paradigm questions — "which spine is this," "is my structure working at the whole-work level" — use the `plot-architecture` skill instead per `plot-architecture/SKILL.md §Plot Architecture vs. Pass 2 (Structural Mapping) — Boundary`) |
| 3 | Rhythm & Modulation | 0, 1 | `[Project]_Pass3_Rhythm_[runlabel].md` |
| 4 | Emotional Value Tracking | 0, 1 | `[Project]_Pass4_Emotional_[runlabel].md` |
| 5 | Character Audit | 0 | `[Project]_Pass5_Character_Audit_[runlabel].md` |
| 6 | Scene Function Audit | 0, 2 | `[Project]_Pass6_Scene_Function_[runlabel].md` |
| 7 | POV & Voice | 0, 5 | `[Project]_Pass7_POV_Voice_[runlabel].md` |
| 8 | Reveal Economy | 0 | `[Project]_Pass8_Reveal_Economy_[runlabel].md` |
| 9 | Thematic Coherence | 0, 5 | `[Project]_Pass9_Thematic_[runlabel].md` |

Tier 2 passes run only when selected by the query resolver. Each depends on one or more Tier 1 passes, which are automatically included when a Tier 2 pass is selected.

### Tier 3 — Synthesize

| Pass | Name | Depends on | Output artifact |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Synthesis | Root cause analysis + editorial letter + results guide | All selected Tier 2 passes | `[Project]_Synthesis_[runlabel].md` + `[Project]_Results_Guide_[runlabel].md` |
| 11 | Critical Quality & Market Viability | 0, 1, 2, 5, Synthesis | `[Project]_Pass11_Critical_Quality_[runlabel].md` |

Synthesis always runs after all selected passes **and all auto-run audits** complete. Auto-run audits (§4a) are synthesis dependencies — synthesis MUST NOT begin until their findings are in the Findings Ledger. Pass 11 runs only when submission readiness is in scope.

### Running Artifacts (not passes)

| Artifact | Type | Built by | Output |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| Findings Ledger | Running document | Appended by each evaluative pass (1, 2, 5, 8, and Full DE passes) after completion | `[Project]_Findings_Ledger_[runlabel].md` |

The Findings Ledger is not a pass. It has no tier. It is appended to by every pass that produces evaluative findings. Pass 0 and Pass 10 are data-building passes and do not append to the ledger unless they surface an observation that warrants it (e.g., a Rule Ledger inconsistency in an SFF run). The Synthesis step reads the Findings Ledger as its primary input for root cause analysis.

## §2. Query-to-Pass Resolver

### Resolution logic

1. Router output includes a **concern** (from Q2 or from targeted intake).
2. Look up the concern in the table below to get the minimum pass set.
3. For each selected pass, resolve its dependencies from §1. Add all upstream passes.
4. Deduplicate. Order by tier (Tier 1 first, Tier 2 second, Tier 3 last).
5. Within a tier, passes with no mutual dependencies can run in parallel.

### Concern → Minimum pass set

| User concern | Minimum passes | Macro block |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Structure / architecture | 0, 2 | Structure Map |
| Pacing / momentum | 0, 1, 3 | Reader Dynamics |
| Characters / agency / arc | 0, 1, 5, 7 | Character Architecture |
| Information flow / reveals | 0, 1, 8 | Reveal Economy |
| Scene craft / function | 0, 2, 6 | Scene Delivery |
| Theme / coherence / meaning | 0, 5, 9, 10 | Theme & Continuity |
| Emotional dynamics / interiority | 0, 1, 4 | Emotional Dynamics |
| General diagnostic ("what's wrong?") | 0, 1, 2, 5, 8 | **Baseline (see §2a)** |
| Full diagnostic ("everything") | all passes | Full |
| Submission readiness | all + 11 | Submission Readiness |

### §2a-partial. Partial manuscript pass behavior

When `artifact=partial` is set, the standard resolver applies but all passes operate under modified expectations defined in `references/partial-manuscript.md`. Key differences:

- **Pass 0** adds a Momentum Report (where the draft stops, what's building)
- **Pass 1** adds stall detection and momentum tracking; marks undelivered promises as "open" not "broken"
- **Pass 2** maps available structure without projecting complete architecture; reports trajectory not template
- **Pass 5** tracks arc trajectory without penalizing incomplete arcs
- **Pass 8** includes a Setup Inventory; marks unresolved setups as assets not failures
- **Synthesis** produces a Partial Diagnostic Letter focused on "what's working, what's stalling, where to go next"

The baseline floor (Passes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8) applies to partial manuscripts as it does to complete drafts. Auto-escalation to full pass set (§2b) is suppressed for partial manuscripts — the triggers assume complete-manuscript data.

### §2a. Baseline floor rule

The "General diagnostic" row is the **floor**, not one option among equals. Apply it when:

- The user says "what's wrong" or any equivalent without specifying a concern.
- The router's fallback disambiguator fires.
- The user's answer is ambiguous and cannot be confidently mapped to a specific concern.

This replicates the current Core DE pass set (0, 1, 2, 5, 8) exactly. The baseline ensures that query-driven resolution never produces a thinner diagnostic than what users currently get from a standard run.

### §2b. Auto-escalation rule

After synthesis on any query-driven subset, check the Full DE trigger conditions:

- Synthesis identifies >5 root causes
- Reader Experience (Pass 1) logs >10 major issues
- Structural complexity flags fire (multiple timelines, unreliable narrators, non-linear structure)
- Author reports persistent unidentifiable problems or revision loops

If any trigger fires, recommend expanding to the full pass set. This is a recommendation, not automatic escalation. The system surfaces it explicitly:

> "Based on what I'm finding, the issues are interconnected enough that a full diagnostic would catch things this focused run can't. Want me to expand to the full pass set?"

The user can decline. If they accept, resolve the full pass set and continue.

---

## §3. Macro Block Definitions

User-facing groupings that organize output. Writers see 8 blocks, not 12 passes. The editorial letter groups findings by macro block within each severity tier (primary sort: severity; secondary grouping: macro block).

| Macro Block | Internal Passes | User Question |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Structure Map | 0 + 2 | "Is the structure working?" |
| Reader Dynamics | 1 + 3 | "Does the pacing hold?" |
| Character Architecture | 5 + 7 | "Are my characters landing?" |
| Emotional Dynamics | 4 | "Are the emotional beats earning their weight?" |
| Scene Delivery | 6 | "Are the scenes doing their jobs?" |
| Reveal Economy | 8 | "Is the information flow right?" |
| Theme & Continuity | 9 + 10 | "Does it cohere?" |
| Submission Readiness | 11 | "Is this ready?" |

Pass 7 (POV & Voice) belongs to Character Architecture because voice is a character concern. Pass 4 (Emotional Value Tracking) has its own block — it was previously subordinated to Character Architecture, but emotional dynamics is a distinct diagnostic dimension.

When a query-driven run selects a subset of passes, only the relevant macro blocks appear in the editorial letter. Blocks with no selected passes are omitted entirely — not shown as empty.

---

## §4. Audit Resolver

The pass resolver (§2) determines which passes run. The audit resolver determines which specialized audits to surface. Both draw from the same concern signal (router output + pass findings).

**Audit-signal propagation:** Audit-internal severity signals (Must-Fix floors, hard gates, HIGH/Alert ratings) propagate to synthesis-layer Must-Fix / Should-Fix / Could-Fix per the canonical rule in `run-synthesis.md §Step 2 — Canonical Audit-Signal Propagation Rule`. Per-audit propagation specifics — which audit-internal signal classes map to which synthesis severities for which audits — live in §4e (Audit-Signal Propagation Table). Audits not enumerated in §4e fall back to the canonical rule's default mapping.

### §4a. Router-triggered audits

Activated by intake answers before passes run. When a router-triggered audit is also surfaced via a finding-trigger in §4b, the highest-obligation tier wins per §4f.

**Tier verification (Phase 6 Wave 2 / CR-3 closure).** All router-triggered audit tier assignments below were re-audited per the Phase 6 plan against Phase 2 archaeology, Phase 3 inventory classifications, and Codex critique CR-3 evidence. Result: existing tiers hold. The Auto-recommend before synthesis tier for Reception Risk and Consent Complexity (the two router-triggered audits at that obligation tier) was confirmed against Phase 2 finding that absent these audits, the run records an explicit blind spot — the obligation tier's defining condition. Auto-run audits (Constraint=ai → AI-Prose; Erotic Content; Memoir; Narrative NF) were confirmed against the §4c Auto-run definition: bundled at intake because the audit is definitional to the manuscript type. No router-tier promotions or demotions in this wave; future audit additions follow the §4c Audit Tier Promotion Criteria.

| Router signal | Audit(s) | Policy | Reference file |
|---------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Genre = Horror (Psychological) | Horror Craft Integration | Auto-recommend after Pass 1 | `genre/horror-craft.md` |
| Genre = Supernatural Horror | Supernatural Horror | Auto-recommend after Pass 1 | `genre/supernatural-horror.md` |
| Genre = Grimdark / Dark Fantasy | Grimdark / Dark Fantasy | Auto-recommend after Pass 1 | `genre/grimdark.md` |
| Genre = Mystery | Mystery/Thriller Architecture | Auto-recommend after Pass 8 | `genre/mystery-thriller-architecture.md` |
| Genre = Thriller | Mystery/Thriller Architecture | Auto-recommend after Pass 8 | `genre/mystery-thriller-architecture.md` |
| Genre = SF/Fantasy | SFF Worldbuilding Integration | Auto-recommend after Pass 10 | `genre/sff-worldbuilding.md` |
| Genre = Literary | Literary Craft Deep Dive | Auto-recommend after Pass 9 | `craft/literary-craft.md` |
| Constraint = ai | AI-Prose Calibration | Auto-run (bundled with workflow) | `craft/ai-prose-calibration.md` |
| Erotic content flagged at intake | Erotic Content | Auto-run (bundled with workflow) | `tag/erotic-content.md` |
| Genre = Romance + erotic content | Erotic Content + Consent Complexity | Auto-run / Auto-recommend | `tag/erotic-content.md`, `tag/consent-complexity.md` |
| Erotic or intimate content + power dynamics / conditioning / authority asymmetry / consent ambiguity disclosed | Consent Complexity | Auto-recommend before synthesis | `tag/consent-complexity.md` |
| Historical setting (>50 years) | Historical Fiction | Auto-recommend | `genre/historical-fiction.md` |
| Memoir or creative nonfiction | Memoir & Creative Nonfiction | Auto-run (bundled) | `genre/memoir-creative-nonfiction.md` |
| Narrative nonfiction | Narrative Nonfiction Craft | Auto-run (bundled) | `genre/narrative-nonfiction.md` |
| Short fiction (<20K words) | Short Fiction | Auto-recommend | `craft/short-fiction.md` |
| Series context flagged | Series & Composite Novel | Auto-recommend | `craft/series-composite-novel.md` |
| Series continuity concern | Series Continuity | Auto-run (requires Pass 10 + Pass 8) | `craft/series-continuity.md` |
| Representation or reception sensitivity disclosed at intake | Reception Risk | Auto-recommend before synthesis | `craft/reception-risk.md` |
| Queer romance / queer identity central | Queer Romance/Erotica | Auto-recommend | `tag/queer-romance-erotica.md` |
| Submission readiness goal | Shelf Positioning | Auto-recommend with Pass 11 | `craft/shelf-positioning.md` |
| Constraint = risk | Legal Risk Register | **Wired** — offer-then-attach on `constraint:risk` (synthesis constraint hook, `run-synthesis.md §Constraint mode`); direct entry `/legal-risk`. Overlay per `intake-router-runtime.md` §6 Table B. | `references/legal-risk-register.md` |

### §4b. Finding-triggered audits

Activated by pass results during a diagnostic run. The system checks these after each pass completes. When a finding-triggered audit is also surfaced via §4a or via another §4b finding-trigger, the highest-obligation tier wins per §4f.

**Tier verification (Phase 6 Wave 2 / CR-3 closure).** All finding-triggered audit tier assignments below were re-audited per the Phase 6 plan. Confirmed against Phase 2 archaeology (commit history showing five audits — Compression, Female Interiority, Scene Turn, Interiority Preservation, Decision Pressure — promoted from Recommend to Auto-recommend before synthesis to catch omission patterns that undermine the whole letter if skipped) and against Phase 4's audit-signal propagation work. The promotions hold. Demotion candidates considered and rejected: Compression / Female Interiority / Interiority Preservation / Scene Turn / Decision Pressure (catch undetectable-by-passes-alone omissions; blind-spot disclosure is non-equivalent to running them); AI-Prose / Reception Risk (hard gate semantics make synthesis-without-them confidence-limiting). Recommend tier on Character Architecture, Emotional Craft, Banister, and others remains: each catches a class of issue that *could* be inferred from passes, so opt-in is the right tier. The Banister-for-thematic-runs candidate flagged in Phase 3 is documented in §4e (its propagation entry) but the tier stays at Recommend pending stronger Phase 7 evidence.

| Any pass | Unsupported choice architecture, false dilemmas, or abstract risk persistence | Decision Pressure | Auto-recommend before synthesis |
| Any pass | Consent ambiguity, governance legibility failure, coercion aestheticization risk, or aftercare / repair incoherence in intimate or power-dynamic material | Consent Complexity | Auto-recommend before synthesis |

### §4c. Policy definitions

The tier definitions below establish the obligation ordering used by the §4f Audit Tier Precedence Rule: **Hard Prerequisite > Pre-DE Prerequisite > Auto-run > Auto-recommend before synthesis > Auto-recommend > Recommend**.

- **Hard Prerequisite (Phase 6 Wave 3):** Audit MUST complete before any Tier 2 evaluative pass can begin. This is stronger than Auto-run: Auto-run audits are *synthesis* dependencies (they must complete before synthesis), but Hard Prerequisite audits are *pass* dependencies (they must complete before the passes themselves run). Used when the audit's output materially changes what the passes are evaluating against — e.g., Field Reconnaissance for high-stakes argument-shaped runs, where surfacing literature-counterevidence before the argument engine fires changes the claim graph that Dialectical Clarity / Argument Red Team / Argument Evidence operate on. **A user-declined Hard Prerequisite cannot proceed silently.** If the user declines, the run either (a) terminates with an explicit "Hard Prerequisite declined; argument-engine passes cannot run as configured — re-route as Auto-recommend before synthesis with blind-spot disclosure?" prompt, or (b) downgrades to Auto-recommend before synthesis with a body-of-letter disclosure recorded at synthesis. There is no third path; silent omission is forbidden at this tier.
- **Pre-DE Prerequisite (Phase 6 Wave 3):** Audit runs *before* the Development Edit begins; it is **not** a DE-internal audit. Used for source-integrity work that establishes evidentiary preconditions (Citation Verifier for high-stakes argument-shaped runs, where ghost citations / quote drift / paraphrase inflation would invalidate downstream argument analysis). The audit's output (e.g., `Citation_Ledger.md`) is consumed by argument-cluster passes but the audit itself is not part of the pass dependency graph — it is a precondition for the run, not a member of it. See the audit's reference file for the full pre-DE handoff protocol.
- **Auto-run:** Audit loads without user confirmation. Bundled with the workflow from intake. Used for audits that are definitional to the manuscript type (e.g., Memoir audit for a memoir, AI-Prose for an AI-assisted draft). **Auto-run audits are synthesis dependencies.** They must complete and append their findings to the Findings Ledger before synthesis begins. This ensures synthesis integrates auto-run audit findings into root cause analysis and triage rather than requiring post-hoc retrofitting.
- **Auto-recommend:** System recommends after the relevant pass completes. The user can decline. Used for genre-specific audits that would catch issues the passes surface but can't fully diagnose. Auto-recommend audits run after their triggering pass; if the user accepts and the audit completes before synthesis begins, its findings are integrated. If it completes after synthesis, its findings appear in the editorial letter appendix as "post-synthesis audit — not integrated into triage."
- **Auto-recommend before synthesis:** Same as Auto-recommend, but the recommendation must be resolved before synthesis begins. If the user declines or defers, the run records an explicit blind spot in the Audit Invocation Log and the synthesis/readiness layer must name the confidence limit. This policy applies to critical structural and consent issues that undermine the core framework (e.g., Compression, Interiority, AI-Prose).
- **Recommend:** System mentions availability when findings suggest relevance. The user opts in. Used for cross-cutting audits that *might* be relevant based on patterns. Same post-synthesis labeling applies if they complete late.

#### Audit Tier Promotion Criteria

A new audit (or a re-audited existing audit) earns Auto-recommend before synthesis status when **all three** of the following hold:

1. **The audit has named hard gates or audit-internal Must-Fix floors.** Audits with only Note/Flag/Recommend-style outputs do not warrant the Auto-recommend before synthesis tier — the obligation is reserved for audits that produce signals strong enough to gate synthesis severity.
2. **The audit catches a class of issue undetectable by passes alone.** If the passes' Findings Ledger reliably surfaces the issue without the audit, the audit is supplementary (Recommend tier). The Auto-recommend before synthesis tier is for audits whose absence creates a *blind spot* — an issue the synthesis cannot otherwise see.
3. **Blind-spot disclosure is non-equivalent to running the audit.** That is, naming "we did not run X" in Appendix A is materially weaker than running X and integrating its findings. Audits where the disclosure adequately substitutes for the audit do not warrant the higher tier.

A new audit earns Auto-run status when **all three** above hold AND **either**: (a) the audit is definitional to the manuscript type (Memoir audit for memoir; AI-Prose for AI-assisted draft); or (b) the audit's prerequisite signals are present at intake without ambiguity (Erotic Content disclosed; Series context disclosed with Pass 10+8 prerequisites).

A new audit earns Auto-recommend status when criterion 1 holds (named hard gates or Must-Fix floors exist) AND criterion 2 *partially* holds (passes detect the issue at lower severity than the audit; the audit refines), but criterion 3 fails (blind-spot disclosure is reasonably substitutable for the audit).

**Decisions get logged.** Each promotion (or principled non-promotion) is recorded in the changelog entry that introduces it. Phase 2 archaeology surfaced cfaadef's batch promotion of five audits; future audit additions follow the criterion above with explicit rationale. The §4a/§4b verification subsections at the start of each table document the criterion's application to existing audits.

### §4d. Presentation format & Priority Queue

When recommending an audit, use this format:

> **Audit available: [Audit Name]**
> Pass [N] found [brief finding summary]. The [Audit Name] audit would test [what it specifically diagnoses]. Want me to run it?

Do not list multiple recommendations simultaneously. Present them one at a time after the relevant pass, in the order specified by the priority queue below.

**Priority queue (when multiple audits trigger from the same pass).** Apply ordering rules in sequence; the first rule that distinguishes the audits is dispositive:

1. **Higher tier fires first.** Auto-run > Auto-recommend before synthesis > Auto-recommend > Recommend. (Auto-run audits should already be loaded; this rule mainly orders the remaining recommendations.)
2. **Within the same tier, higher audit-internal severity fires first.** Hard gate beats Must-Fix floor beats HIGH/Alert beats MEDIUM/Flag beats LOW/Note. The audit-internal severity comes from the audit reference file's named-flag table.
3. **Within the same internal severity, higher signal count fires first.** An audit whose finding-trigger fired three times beats an audit whose finding-trigger fired once. Signal count comes from the Audit Invocation Log rationale column (per §4f).
4. **Tie-breaking: alphabetical by audit name** for deterministic queue ordering.

**Re-prompt suppression.** A user-recommended user-declined audit does not re-prompt within the same run unless the §4f tier-precedence rule fires (declined-at-Recommend, later-promoted-by-finding-trigger to Auto-recommend before synthesis re-prompts with the new tier rationale; declined-at-Auto-recommend-before-synthesis does not re-prompt — the blind-spot disclosure persists).

**Tier resolution precedes queue ordering.** Per §4f cross-reference: when an audit is surfaced through multiple paths, resolve its tier first (highest obligation wins). Then apply the priority queue to order surface presentation.

**Worked examples.**

*Example 1 — Pass 5 finding triggers two audits at different tiers.*
Pass 5 (Character Audit) surfaces female POV interiority thinning AND voice drift. From §4b: Female Interiority is Auto-recommend before synthesis; Scene Turn (voice drift trigger) is also Auto-recommend before synthesis. Both at the same tier. Apply rule 2: assume Female Interiority's audit-internal Must-Fix floor fires (≥3 thinning instances in interiority-load scenes); Scene Turn's audit-internal Should-Fix-default flag fires for the voice drift signal. Female Interiority's hard signal beats Scene Turn's softer one — Female Interiority presents first; Scene Turn presents second.

*Example 2 — Pass 1 finding triggers Compression (Auto-recommend before synthesis) AND Reception Risk (Auto-recommend before synthesis from §4a router-trigger).*
Both at Auto-recommend before synthesis tier. Apply rule 2: Reception Risk Alert (hard-gate-class signal from §7) beats Compression Must-Fix floor (Must-Fix-floor-class signal). Reception Risk presents first; Compression presents second.

*Example 3 — Pass 9 finding triggers Dialectical Clarity (Recommend) AND Banister (Recommend).*
Both at Recommend tier. Apply rule 2: assume both produce Flag-class signals at MEDIUM. Apply rule 3: if Dialectical Clarity's finding-trigger fired three times across passes (warrant-gap convergence in 1, 5, 9) and Banister fired once (only Pass 9), Dialectical Clarity presents first. Apply rule 4 only if rules 2-3 don't distinguish: alphabetical (Banister < Dialectical Clarity).

### §4e. Audit-Signal Propagation Table (per-audit operationalization of the Canonical Rule)

This is the per-audit operationalization of the Canonical Audit-Signal Propagation Rule. Canonical home: `run-synthesis.md §Step 2 — Canonical Audit-Signal Propagation Rule`. The canonical rule defines the *propagation taxonomy* (Must-Fix floor → synthesis Must-Fix; hard gate → synthesis Must-Fix; HIGH → synthesis Must-Fix or Should-Fix per audit context; MEDIUM → synthesis Should-Fix; LOW → synthesis Could-Fix). This table specifies *per-audit applicability*: for each audit, which audit-internal signal classes propagate to which synthesis severity, and what context modifiers apply.

**How to read each row.** Each row maps one audit-internal signal class to one synthesis severity. An audit may produce multiple signal classes; each gets its own row. Where audit-internal signals are context-modified (e.g., Compression's Must-Fix floor only applies in specific channels; Reception Risk Alerts vary by genre context), the Context column documents the modifier. The Source column points to the audit reference file specifying the signal class. The Override column flags any deviation from the canonical default mapping.

**Validator integration.** The `scripts/validate.sh audit-signal-propagation` validator (Phase 4) reads this table to verify that audit-internal signals reach the editorial letter at the rule-mandated synthesis severity. The Phase 4 default mapping (canonical rule's column 2) is the fallback for any audit not enumerated here; the per-audit entries below refine the default for audit-specific context.

**Override path.** Per-audit refinements that diverge from the canonical default mapping are documented in the Override column with a brief rationale. Synthesis-time overrides for individual findings still follow the canonical rule's body-only marker pattern (`<!-- override: audit-propagation-must-fix — <rationale> -->`, etc.).

#### Universal audits

Narrative-decision evidence is interpretive and does not license a verdict per the audit's claim_license `does_not_license`; the Should-Fix ceiling applies only on convergence with texture-level evidence |
| Narrative-Decision (StoryScope) | Per-signal AI-leaning contribution (isolated signal, direction=ai) | Could-Fix | Informational; per-signal structural evidence presented before synthesis | `craft/narrative-decision-audit.md` §Interpreting the output | **Provisional 2026-05-29** — No Must-Fix floor; advisory structural evidence |

| Argument-Decision (ArgScope) | Both B1 (paragraph-role arc) and B2 (discourse-mode mix) AI-leaning AND convergence with texture-level AI-Prose Calibration evidence on the same essay | Should-Fix | Convergent cross-audit signal only; never gates alone | `craft/argument-decision-audit.md` §Interpreting the output + §Anti-verdict discipline | **Provisional 2026-06-13** — Mirrors the Narrative-Decision posture; no Must-Fix floor (surface is `handoff: experimental`, ships uncalibrated, op-ed register-bound). Argument-decision evidence is interpretive and does not license a verdict per the audit's claim_license `does_not_license` (diversity ≠ quality/soundness); the Should-Fix ceiling applies only on convergence with texture-level evidence |
| Argument-Decision (ArgScope) | Per-signal AI-leaning contribution (isolated B1/B2 signal, direction=ai) | Could-Fix | Informational; per-signal structural evidence presented before synthesis | `craft/argument-decision-audit.md` §Interpreting the output | **Provisional 2026-06-13** — No Must-Fix floor; advisory structural evidence. B3/B4 `reused_signals` are heuristic/descriptive (no numeric anchor) and never carry a tier |
| Argument-Decision (ArgScope) | SETEC `aggregate.score` / `verdict_band` | Could-Fix (provenance only) | Not pinned; surfaced as provenance metadata, not a severity signal | `craft/argument-decision-audit.md` §Aggregate posture | **Provisional 2026-06-13** — APODICTIC does not pin verdicts to SETEC's aggregate; band ships `uncalibrated`. Outside the op-ed register (research/legal/policy = `distant` tier) only structural signals surface, with no anchored contributions |
| POV Voice Profile | Voice-collapse verdict on 2+ POV pairs AND Pass 7 Blind Swap fails on the same pairs | Must-Fix | Convergent quantitative + qualitative signals on multiple pairs | `craft/pov-voice-profile.md` §Severity / Readiness Impact | **Validated 2026-06-19 (audit-signal-propagation self-test + multi-POV fixture)** — Must-Fix-floor propagation exercised; this is the only row the propagation validator can mechanically check (see §4e validation note) |
| POV Voice Profile | Voice-collapse verdict on 1 POV pair AND Blind Swap fails on that pair | Should-Fix | Convergent on a single pair; pattern-level | `craft/pov-voice-profile.md` §Severity / Readiness Impact | **Provisional 2026-06-19 (not fixture-exercised; see §4e validation note)** — editorial call: Should-Fix on convergent single pair. Alternatives considered: Must-Fix (any convergence warrants a floor); Could-Fix (single-pair scope limits blast radius). Should-Fix matches the spirit of the reference doc's "Could-Fix on 1 pair + Blind Swap pass" entry while honoring the convergence elevation precedent at Stakes System line 294 |
| POV Voice Profile | Voice-collapse verdict (any pair count) AND Blind Swap passes | Could-Fix | Stylometry-only signal; pass-output names the contradiction per Pass 7 contradiction-reporting convention; advisory rather than gating | `craft/pov-voice-profile.md` §Severity / Readiness Impact + `run-full.md` §Pass 7 SETEC supplementation step 7 | **Provisional 2026-06-19 (not fixture-exercised; see §4e validation note)** — editorial call: Could-Fix on stylometry-LLM contradiction. Alternative considered: Should-Fix (stylometry catches what LLM missed; SETEC's point is to surface measurement signal the qualitative reading misses). Could-Fix preserves Pass 7's craft-judgment primacy; Should-Fix would invert it |
| POV Voice Profile | Any base signal AND collapse-threshold call is within 5% of SETEC cutoff | Downshift one tier from the corresponding base row | The SETEC collapse threshold is a heuristic on a calibration roadmap; borderline calls defer to the qualitative Blind Swap (Must-Fix→Should-Fix; Should-Fix→Could-Fix; Could-Fix remains Could-Fix with advisory note) | `craft/pov-voice-profile.md` §Inputs (collapse threshold note) | **Provisional 2026-06-19 (not fixture-exercised; see §4e validation note)** — Refines default (threshold-confidence-conditional). If folded into parent rows' Context column instead of standing as its own row, the table tightens by one row; current placement makes the convention explicit |
| POV Voice Profile | Any base signal AND POV mapping was LLM-detected (cascade step 3, not author-confirmed) | Downshift one tier from the corresponding base row | Stylometry was fit on possibly-incorrect segmentation; author confirmation at any later point restores base tier | `craft/pov-voice-profile.md` §When NOT to Activate + `run-full.md` §Pass 7 POV mapping cascade | **Provisional 2026-06-19 (not fixture-exercised; see §4e validation note)** — Refines default (provenance-conditional). This downshift is not in the audit reference doc; introduced here by extrapolation from the run-full.md "author-not-confirmed caveat" convention. Most likely to want adjustment after first real fixture |
| Content Advisory | No propagating signal — descriptive sensitivity-surface map only (the `content-advisory` A3 no-severity-leak gate forbids the advisory from carrying any severity) | None (default mapping) | Always; Content Advisory derives *what is depicted, where, how intensely* for content-warning / retailer-metadata / sensitivity-handoff use, never a craft/harm verdict. Craft and harm severity come from sibling audits (Reception Risk, the relevant tag/consent audits), not from this map | `content-advisory.md` §Purpose + `scripts/validate.sh content-advisory` (A3 no-severity-leak) | **Descriptive audit (no audit-internal severity class).** Carded so the propagation validator's registry check confirms it is accounted for; it emits nothing to propagate, so the canonical default mapping applies vacuously. See the Content Advisory / Reader-Persona Simulation §4e note below |
| Reader-Persona Simulation | No new propagating signal — divergence map re-reads existing Pass-1 (Reader Dynamics) findings through declared reading dispositions; a divergence's optional `asserted_severity` must **equal** the anchored finding's locked Ledger severity AND may be asserted only against a Ledger finding — a Timeline-locus anchor (no locked verdict) must carry none (the `persona-divergence` D3 gate rejects ANY deviation — downgrade, inflation, or an unanchored severity), so the overlay emits no severity of its own | None new (severity stays anchored to the underlying Pass-1 finding) | Always; "works for the expert, fails for the newcomer" is recorded descriptively against the persona, and the target persona anchors severity. The map introduces no audit-internal severity of its own — the underlying Pass-1 finding propagates under its own §4e/default mapping | `craft/persona-divergence.md` §"Severity honesty — the target persona anchors severity" + `scripts/validate.sh persona-divergence` (D3) | **Descriptive overlay (no new audit-internal severity class).** Carded so the registry check accounts for it; the underlying reader-dynamics finding — not this overlay — is what propagates. See the Content Advisory / Reader-Persona Simulation §4e note below |

**POV Voice Profile §4e validation note (added 2026-05-18; Must-Fix row validated 2026-06-19).** Only the **Must-Fix row** (voice-collapse on 2+ POV pairs + Blind-Swap fail) is fixture-validated. The `scripts/validate.sh audit-signal-propagation` self-test exercises it directly (in-code cases `pov_propagated_clean` / `pov_unpropagated_errors` / `pov_override_body_no_error` / `pov_override_body_warns` in `letter_checks.py` `run_self_test`) via a believable Mara/Jon + Mara/Elen editorial-letter snippet whose voice-collapse-on-2+-pairs + Blind-Swap-fail signal is expressed as a **Must-Fix floor**, parsed by the validator as audit `POV Voice Profile` (slug `pov-voice-profile`) and checked to propagate (or be overridden) to a synthesis-body Must-Fix. That is the **only** policy the propagation validator can mechanically check: it enforces *canonical propagation* of a **strong** audit-internal signal (hard gate / Must-Fix floor / HIGH) to the mandated synthesis tier — it does **not** derive or verify the per-audit tier *assignments*, and it has no path to assert a Should-Fix or Could-Fix tier or a downshift. The other four rows — the single-pair **Should-Fix** row, the Blind-Swap-pass **Could-Fix** row, and the two downshift modifiers (threshold-confidence and POV-mapping-provenance) — therefore remain **provisional documented editorial conventions**, not fixture-validated (the same provisional posture as the Narrative-/Argument-Decision rows), and stay tunable on a live multi-POV manuscript run. All four use the one Must-Fix scenario only insofar as it proves propagation mechanics; none is exercised by a fixture distinct to its own policy. If a real run reads wrong at an assigned tier, the response is the same as for any §4e row: downshift on over-flagging, or upshift / strengthen Context modifiers on under-flagging.

**Narrative-Decision (StoryScope) §4e note (added 2026-05-29).** The three Narrative-Decision rows above are provisional and intentionally cap at Should-Fix-on-convergence: the surface (SETEC Surface 6 `narrative_decision_audit`) is `handoff: experimental`, ships uncalibrated (no thresholds; `uncalibrated` verdict band), and the audit's claim_license forbids provenance verdicts. Narrative-decision signals therefore never produce an audit-internal Must-Fix floor or hard gate. They propagate as Could-Fix (per-signal, informational) and at most Should-Fix when bundle-level AI-leaning concentration converges with texture-level AI-Prose Calibration evidence — never as a standalone gate. SETEC's `aggregate.score` is surfaced as provenance only and is not pinned. See `craft/narrative-decision-audit.md` §Anti-verdict discipline / §4e propagation. Because the audit produces no high-tier obligation, it sits at Recommend (opt-in) in §4b; the `scripts/validate.sh audit-tier-criterion` exemption for Recommend-tier audits applies.

**Argument-Decision (ArgScope) §4e note (added 2026-06-13).** The argument-domain sibling (SETEC `argument_decision_audit`, `handoff: experimental`, ships uncalibrated, anti-verdict, register-bound to op-ed/public-debate) mirrors the Narrative-Decision posture exactly. The three rows above cap at Should-Fix only when both B1 (paragraph-role arc) and B2 (discourse-mode mix) are AI-leaning AND that converges with texture-level AI-Prose Calibration evidence on the same essay; isolated per-signal evidence is Could-Fix; B3/B4 `reused_signals` are heuristic/descriptive (no numeric anchor by design) and carry no tier; SETEC's `aggregate.score` is surfaced as provenance only and not pinned. In the `distant` tier (research/legal/policy) only structural signals surface — no anchored contributions — so no high-tier obligation is produced there either. No §4b auto-recommend trigger is added: it stays a deliberately opt-in, SETEC-backed surface (revisit if usage warrants). It therefore produces no Must-Fix floor or hard gate, and the `audit-tier-criterion` Recommend-tier exemption applies. See `craft/argument-decision-audit.md` §Anti-verdict discipline / §Aggregate posture.

**Content Advisory / Reader-Persona Simulation §4e note (added 2026-06-22).** Both audits are **descriptive** and emit no audit-internal severity class of their own, so neither produces a propagating signal. **Content Advisory** is a sensitivity-surface map (what is depicted, where, at what intensity) whose `A3 no-severity-leak` gate explicitly forbids it from carrying severity — craft/harm verdicts come from sibling audits (Reception Risk, consent/tag audits), not from the advisory. **Reader-Persona Simulation** is an overlay on Pass 1 (Reader Dynamics): it re-reads existing findings through declared reading dispositions and *locks* severity to the target persona's existing Ledger finding — `D3` requires a divergence's optional `asserted_severity` to **equal** the locked severity AND permits it only against a Ledger finding (a Timeline-locus anchor has no locked verdict, so it must carry none) — rejecting downgrade, inflation, and unanchored severities alike, so the underlying Pass-1 finding — not the overlay — is what propagates. They are nonetheless carded in §4e (with explicit "no propagating signal" rows) so the `audit-signal-propagation --check-registry` completeness check accounts for every signal-emitting registry entry; for these two the canonical default mapping applies vacuously (there is nothing to elevate). They are opt-in/descriptive surfaces and add no §4b auto-recommend trigger.

#### Pass-10-Class structured artifacts

Pass 10 (Timeline) is a data-building pass that carries no severity itself; severity emerges from its Section 4 (Inconsistency Ledger) and propagates per the canonical rule (`pass-10.md` §Synthesis integration). These rows make that propagation explicit.

| Audit | Audit-internal signal | Synthesis severity | Context modifier | Source | Override |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Timeline (Pass 10) | Inconsistency Ledger `paradox` (markers cannot both be true) | Must-Fix | ≥1 paradox; timeline-coherence failure | `pass-10.md` §4 Inconsistency Ledger + §Synthesis integration | — |
| Timeline (Pass 10) | Inconsistency Ledger `drift` (loosely incompatible; visible only when calculated) | Should-Fix | ≥3 drifts; revision-drift hygiene | `pass-10.md` §4 + §Synthesis integration | — |
| Timeline (Pass 10) | Inconsistency Ledger `ambiguity` (under-determined; manuscript does not commit) | Could-Fix | Isolated; **surfaces as an Author Decision (not auto-gated) when tied to a load-bearing structural element** — climax positioning, intervention windows, arc spans | `pass-10.md` §4 + §5 Ambiguity Ledger | Refines default (load-bearing ambiguity → Author Decision, not a severity flag) |

#### Default mapping (fallback for un-enumerated audits)

Audits not enumerated above default to the canonical rule's column-2 mapping (`run-synthesis.md §Step 2`):

- Audit-internal Must-Fix floor → Synthesis Must-Fix
- Audit-internal hard gate → Synthesis Must-Fix
- Audit-internal HIGH / Alert → Synthesis Must-Fix or Should-Fix per audit context (model judgment)
- Audit-internal MEDIUM / Flag → Synthesis Should-Fix
- Audit-internal LOW / Note → Synthesis Could-Fix

Future audit additions should add a §4e row at registration time. Audits with UNPROVEN-status hard gates (per Phase 3 Tag-audit inventory) fall under the default mapping until per-audit refinement lands.

#### Notes on table maintenance

- **Per-audit narrative explanations live in the audit reference files**, not in §4e. Each row references the source file's relevant subsection so the model can load context as needed.
- **The table refines, it does not contradict.** Per-audit entries that diverge from the canonical default carry an Override column note. If the table is silent on a signal class for an enumerated audit, fall back to the canonical default for that class.
- **CR-8 closure cases.** The named CR-8 closure cases — Compression Must-Fix floor, Reception Risk Alert (and coercion-marked Alert), Banister HIGH — appear explicitly above with their context modifiers and synthesis-severity mappings.

### §4f. Audit Tier Precedence Rule (highest obligation wins)

When the same audit is surfaced through multiple paths — most often router-triggered (§4a) **and** finding-triggered (§4b), but also via two distinct finding-triggers in §4b — the **highest obligation tier wins**. The audit runs at the higher tier; lower-tier triggers do not produce additional invocations.

**Tier ordering** (per §4c definitions):

```
Hard Prerequisite  >  Pre-DE Prerequisite  >  Auto-run  >  Auto-recommend before synthesis  >  Auto-recommend  >  Recommend
```

If two paths produce the same audit at different tiers, the audit runs at the highest tier among those paths. The Audit Invocation Log records the resolved tier and notes both source paths in the rationale column (e.g., `Reception Risk | router=Auto-recommend before synthesis + finding=Recommend → resolved Auto-recommend before synthesis`).

**Hard Prerequisite ordering note (Phase 6 Wave 3 / CR-4).** Hard Prerequisite and Pre-DE Prerequisite tiers added in Phase 6 Wave 3 to support Field Reconnaissance and Citation Verifier prerequisite policy on argument-shaped runs. They sit above Auto-run in the ordering because they are *pass* dependencies (must complete before Tier 2 evaluative passes can begin) rather than *synthesis* dependencies. A finding-trigger at Auto-recommend before synthesis cannot promote an audit to Hard Prerequisite — that tier is reserved for router-triggered prerequisite policy on argument-shaped runs with high-stakes signal. The priority queue (§4d) does not reorder Hard Prerequisite / Pre-DE Prerequisite audits within a pass surface — those audits run before passes, so they have no in-pass surface position to order.

**Edge cases:**

1. **Router Auto-run + finding-trigger Recommend.** Audit runs as Auto-run. The router obligation is dispositive; the finding-trigger does not create a duplicate invocation or weaken the tier. (Cross-reference §4a Auto-run policy.)
2. **Router Auto-recommend + finding-trigger Auto-recommend before synthesis.** Audit runs at Auto-recommend before synthesis. The finding-trigger promoted the tier. (Cross-reference §4b finding-trigger policy.)
3. **Two finding-triggers, both Auto-recommend before synthesis.** Audit runs once at Auto-recommend before synthesis (deduplication). Both triggers are recorded in the Audit Invocation Log rationale column; the audit is not invoked twice.
4. **Two finding-triggers, both Recommend, multiple passes fire it.** Audit runs once at Recommend tier (count of triggers does not promote tier; only the highest tier among triggers does). Multiple-pass evidence enters the recommendation framing presented to the user, not the tier.
5. **Audit declined by user at Recommend tier; later finding-trigger fires at Auto-recommend before synthesis.** The new tier rationale changes the obligation. **Re-prompt the user** with the new tier rationale (the prior decline was based on a weaker obligation; the user has not yet had the chance to consider the higher-tier framing). If the user declines again, the run records an explicit blind-spot disclosure per §4c Auto-recommend before synthesis policy.
6. **Audit declined under Auto-recommend before synthesis tier; later finding-trigger fires.** Blind-spot disclosure already logged; the new finding-trigger does not re-prompt. The blind-spot disclosure carries forward to synthesis as the canonical confidence limiter for this audit-class.
7. **Audit-tier precedence interacts with the priority queue (§4d).** Precedence determines tier; the priority queue determines surface order within a pass. Tier resolution happens before queue ordering.
8. **Hard Prerequisite declined by user (Phase 6 Wave 3).** When a Hard Prerequisite audit (router-triggered for an argument-shaped run with high-stakes signal) is declined, the resolver MUST present a fork: (a) terminate the run with a "cannot proceed without literature-counterevidence surfacing for high-stakes argument-shaped runs" advisory, or (b) downgrade to Auto-recommend before synthesis with a body-of-letter blind-spot disclosure that names "literature-counterevidence not surveyed" as a confidence limit at synthesis. The user chooses (a) or (b); the resolver does not silently downgrade. If the user re-affirms (b), the §4c Auto-recommend before synthesis decline path applies thereafter.
9. **Pre-DE Prerequisite declined by user (Phase 6 Wave 3).** When the Pre-DE Prerequisite Citation Verifier is declined for a high-stakes argument-shaped run, the same fork applies: terminate or downgrade-with-disclosure. Citation Verifier declines must additionally name "citation provenance not verified — Ghost Citation / Quote Drift / Paraphrase Inflation risks not surveyed" as the confidence limit at synthesis.

**Cross-references:** §4a (router-triggered audits use this rule when also finding-triggered); §4b (finding-triggered audits use this rule when also router-triggered or fired by multiple passes); §4c (tier definitions provide the ordering); §4d (priority queue applies to surface order *after* tier resolution).

**Validator follow-up (Phase 7):** A `validate.sh audit-tier-precedence <audit_invocation_log>` script could verify that every audit appears at its highest-tier-applied. Deferred to Phase 7; the rule itself is enforceable via documented contract today.

## §5. Interaction with Genre Modules

Genre modules modify pass behavior (thresholds, tracking, flags). The audit resolver is separate from — and complementary to — genre module loading.

- **Genre modules** load at intake and stay active for all passes. They modify *how* passes run.
- **Genre audits** (from §4a/§4b) are deep-dive analyses that run *after* passes. They test whether the genre apparatus is doing narrative work.

A manuscript can have a genre module loaded (e.g., Horror) without running the corresponding audit (Horror Craft Integration). The module ensures passes track the right things; the audit provides the focused integration analysis. The audit resolver recommends the audit; it doesn't force it.

## §6. Interaction with `/audit` Command

The `/audit` command remains a direct-access shortcut. A user who types `/audit force-architecture` gets the Force Architecture audit regardless of what the resolver would recommend.

The resolver handles *automatic* surfacing during diagnostic runs. The `/audit` command handles *deliberate* requests. Both draw from the same audit catalog in `specialized-audits/SKILL.md`.

The resolver does not gate or limit `/audit`. If a user requests an audit that the resolver wouldn't have surfaced, run it without complaint.
