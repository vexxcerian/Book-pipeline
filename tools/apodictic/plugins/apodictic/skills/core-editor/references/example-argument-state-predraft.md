# Argument State: Fund Curb-Cut Ramps Citywide (pre-draft)

<!--
Worked example of a contract-conformant PRE-DRAFT Argument_State, seeded by the Nonfiction
Pre-Draft Pathway (Increment 1 — argument spine; see pre-writing-pathway/references/nonfiction-pre-draft.md
+ docs/nonfiction-pre-draft.md). Before a draft exists, the writer plans the argument: the thesis
(C0), the claim ladder, and the opposing view it must defeat (the anti-thesis → §6 Objection 1).
The spine SEEDS this shared Argument_State.md so the Dialectical Clarity audit and the companion
modules consume one contract. The Firewall holds: the spine plans STRUCTURE, never prose or invented claims.

This file is exercised by `validate.sh --check-all` as a canonical release-gate target for
`argument-spine` (A1 schema, A2 seeds §1/§2, A3 the C0 main-claim carries the thesis; W1 the
anti-thesis names a genuine opposing view), Increment 2 (A4 support-plan schema, A5 each support
plan attaches to a declared subclaim, A6 the support map seeds §3; W2 no bare assertions), and
Increment 3 (A7 warrant-plan schema, A8 each warrant attaches to a declared subclaim, A9 the warrant
map seeds §4; W3 for a HOSTILE audience, warrants are explicit and backed). The remaining
draft-dependent sections (§§5, 7–9) are left PENDING on purpose — they are populated by the
Dialectical Clarity audit once a draft exists.

## 1. Context and Classification

Form: op-ed
Goal: persuade the city council to fund curb-cut ramps citywide in the next budget
Argument type: AT3 — policy recommendation
  Burden level: HIGH
Audience:
  Expertise: MIXED
  Receptivity: HOSTILE
Distinguish classification: _pending — backfilled by Dialectical Clarity Step 9 once a draft exists_

## 2. Claim Architecture

C0 (main claim): the city should fund curb-cut ramps on every downtown corner within two budget cycles

Subclaims:
  C1: missing curb cuts are a documented, daily mobility barrier for wheelchair and stroller users
  C2: the phased cost fits within the existing capital-improvement budget without new taxes
  C3: piecemeal complaint-driven installation has failed to close the gap for a decade

Stakes: residents with mobility needs are effectively excluded from downtown until the gaps close
  Stakes type: MORAL

## 3. Support Map

The source/evidence map (Increment 2): per subclaim, the support the writer plans to bring. Each is a
`support_plan` block; a subclaim with none would be a bare assertion (validator W2). Here all three
are covered, so the spine carries no bare assertions into drafting.

- **C1** — DATA, to acquire: the city accessibility audit's count of non-compliant corners.
- **C2** — AUTHORITY, in hand: the published capital-improvement budget line items.
- **C3** — DATA, to acquire: a decade of complaint-log resolution times.

-->

## 4. Warrant and Inference Map

The warrant pre-check (Increment 3): per subclaim, the principle connecting the support to the claim.
The audience is HOSTILE, so each warrant is planned **EXPLICIT** and backed — an implicit or unbacked
warrant would be flagged (validator W3) as something to make explicit before drafting.

## 6. Objection and Dialectical Integrity Map

Objection 1 (the anti-thesis the argument must defeat): limited capital dollars are better spent on road resurfacing that benefits far more residents
  Engaged: _pending — to be argued in the draft_
