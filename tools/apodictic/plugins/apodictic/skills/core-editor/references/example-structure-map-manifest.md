# Structure Map manifest — worked example

*Canonical worked example for the `manuscript-viz` validator (Manuscript-Structure Visualizations).
The `apodictic.viz_manifest.v1` block below copies — **verbatim** — the three scenes of
[`example-timeline.md`](example-timeline.md) Section 1 and the single `F-RR-01` finding of
[`example-findings-ledger.md`](example-findings-ledger.md). It proves provenance closure (E2),
byte-equal copy fidelity (E4), Must-Fix completeness (E3, `F-RR-01` is a Must-Fix), and the
chapter-honesty parse (its `evidence_refs: ["Chapter 9"]` → the `Ch 9` bin, which has no scenes —
findings bin by chapter independently of the Timeline). Validate with
`scripts/validate.sh manuscript-viz <this file> example-timeline.md example-findings-ledger.md example-argument-state-predraft.md example-scene-roster.md`
(run by `--check-all`). Render with `scripts/viz_manifest.py render <this file> example-timeline.md example-findings-ledger.md example-argument-state-predraft.md example-scene-roster.md -o out.html`.*

The manifest carries **only traceable data** — no per-finding color, size, or emphasis. The
severity→encoding map is hardcoded in the renderer, so there is structurally nothing to soften.

**Chart 5 — the character co-presence network.** The `co_presence[]` array below is the chart-5
render deliverable. Each entry is copied — **verbatim** — from the
[`example-scene-roster.md`](example-scene-roster.md) producer (`apodictic.scene_roster.v1`): the
`scene_id` matches a roster entry and a Timeline row, and the `characters[]` are the **bare canonical
names** of that scene's roster (the auditable `{name, anchor}` richness lives in the producer, not
here). It proves X2 (every name is a rostered/present character; the Timeline POV is in the roster; the
scene resolves to a Timeline row) and X8 (the producer must exist). The render computes edges/weights
**mechanically** — Mara + Adrian share two scenes (an edge, weight 2), *Eleanor* (mentioned in dialogue,
never rostered) draws no edge, *Jon* is an isolated node, and the *"Mara Voss"* surface form collapses
to *Mara* via the producer's alias table.

**Chart 7-nonfiction — the claim ladder.** The `claim_ladder[]` array below is the render-only M1
deliverable of the Manuscript-Visualization Completion increment. Each rung is copied — **verbatim** —
from [`example-argument-state-predraft.md`](example-argument-state-predraft.md): the `claim_id` is a
declared spine subclaim (`C1`/`C2`/`C3`, resolved via `argument_spine.spine_subclaim_ids()`); the
`label` is that subclaim string with its leading `Cn:` token stripped; and each `support[]` item
(`support_type` + `status`) is copied from a real `apodictic.support_plan.v1` block keyed on that
`subclaim_id`. It proves X1 (the array carries **no scene axis** — no `scene_ids`/`scene_id`/`section`
key), X5/X6 (every rung byte-traces to the spine + support plan), and X7 (no duplicate rung). This is
the **declared** claim ladder and its support coverage — *not* a claim-to-scene map (no producer maps
a subclaim to a location, by design).
