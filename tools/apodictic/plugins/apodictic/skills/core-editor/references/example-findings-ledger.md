## Pass — Reception Risk — Ledger Entry

### Notable Findings

1. **Compressed timeline reads as a continuity break.** Chapter 9 collapses three days into two sentences, so a reader tracking the cast's whereabouts loses the thread; the compression is legible as a mistake rather than a choice. This is the kind of seam a hostile reader screenshots.
   *(See Pass — Reception Risk, §Timeline.)*
