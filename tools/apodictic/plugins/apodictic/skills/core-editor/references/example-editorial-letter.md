# Development Edit — Worked Example

<!--
Worked example of a contract-conformant Development Edit synthesis letter (see
run-synthesis.md §Step 7 Decision-Layer Consolidation + output-policy.md §Mandatory
Appendices / §Evidence Density Self-Check / §Severity Floor Rules). This file is exercised by
`validate.sh --check-all` as a canonical release-gate target for `decision-layer-check`,
`audit-signal-propagation`, `softness-check`, and `finding-trace` (the Reception Risk hard gate
in the §Diagnostic Detail appendix propagates to the synthesis-body Must-Fix below, which is
delivered for finding F-RR-01 and locked in the paired example-findings-ledger.md). It is
illustrative, not a run artifact; keep it passing when the letter contracts or the validators
change. Keep this header note free of the appendix-heading words softness-check uses to find the
body boundary, or it will truncate the body before the delivered finding.

## What the Book Does Best

The dual-POV voice holds across both timelines, and the close earns its restraint.

## What Needs Work

- **Must-Fix:** Pacing collapse in the middle third. The Reception Risk Audit hard gate at
  L2956 surfaces here; the same compression recurs in Chapter 7 (lines 142-160) and again in
  Chapter 9 (line 220), where three days pass in two sentences. <!-- finding: F-RR-01 -->
- **Should-Fix:** The prologue's frame competes with Chapter 1 for the reader's first
  orientation (Chapter 1, lines 1-40).

## Protected Elements

- Voice consistency across Part I.
- The dual-POV architecture between Mara and Jon.
- The sister-relationship arc through the close.
- The final image of Chapter 12.

## Author Decisions

### Keep

- Keep the dual POV.
- Keep the unreliable-narrator frame.

### Cut

- Cut the prologue.

### Unsure

- Unsure whether Chapter 5 stays in Part I or moves to Part II.

## Control Questions

1. What does the protagonist learn in the final third?
2. Whose POV closes Part II?
3. Does the prologue earn its place?
4. What is the cost of Chapter 7's choice?
5. Is Chapter 5 working in its current position?
6. Does the final image land as intended?
7. What is the book's controlling idea?

## Appendix A — Diagnostic Detail

### Reception Risk Audit

Hard Gate triggered on Alert concentration at L2956 (aftermath compression in the middle
third). Cross-referenced to Chapter 7 (lines 142-160).

## Appendix B — Severity Calibration

Severity tested upward and downward; the Must-Fix above held at Must-Fix under both directions.
The structured entry below is the machine-readable form `softness-check` reads (it records the
locked vs delivered tier per finding ID, so softening can't hide in prose):

<!-- apodictic:severity_calibration
{"schema":"apodictic.severity_calibration.v1","id":"F-RR-01","locked":"Must-Fix","delivered":"Must-Fix","direction":"unchanged","rationale":"Stress-tested for softening against the Reception Risk hard gate; held at Must-Fix in both directions."}
