# Argument State: Seed Pitch — AccessMap Routing (pre-draft, genre profile)

<!--
Worked example of a GENRE-PROFILED pre-draft Argument_State for a PITCH DECK (Nonfiction Pre-Draft
Pathway, argument-spine Increment 5 — the genre layer; see docs/nonfiction-pre-draft.md). A pitch deck
must run the problem → solution → traction narrative or the investor bounces. The genre profile declares
the genre-required roles (problem / solution / traction); each seeds a ### sub-heading under the
canonical §1–§6. The evaluator is an investor reading fast: compression is expected (the audit loosens on
exhaustive support, tightens on the problem→solution warrant — the WR0 between "here is a pain" and
"therefore our thing"); FM-A8 (False Precision Theater) is the signature risk (vanity-metric traction).

FIREWALL BOUNDARY (the riskiest genre): the genre layer diagnoses whether the ARGUMENT of the deck holds.
It NEVER coaches slide design, slide count, or fundraising tactics — that is the rhetoric-coaching line
the Dialectical Clarity audit already forbids. It invents no problem, no solution, no traction numbers.

Exercised by `validate.sh --check-all`: B1 schema, B2 each declared section seeded, B3 genre agrees with
the spine's form, B4 one profile, W4 all three canonical roles declared.

## 1. Context and Classification

Form: pitch-deck
Goal: win a seed investment for an accessibility-routing product
Argument type: AT3 — propositional (back this), highly compressed
  Burden level: MEDIUM
Audience:
  Expertise: MIXED (investor reading fast)
  Receptivity: MIXED
Evaluator: investor (loosen on exhaustive support; tighten on the problem→solution warrant; FM-A8 is the signature risk)

### Problem

_seeded by stakes — wheelchair and stroller users have no reliable accessible-routing option; the market window closes if a generalist ships first._

## 2. Claim Architecture

C0 (main claim): AccessMap should be backed because accessible-routing demand is unmet and our wedge converts

Subclaims:
  C1: wheelchair and stroller users have no reliable accessible-routing option (the problem)
  C2: our curb-level routing graph is the wedge that solves it (the solution)
  C3: early pilot usage shows the wedge converts (the traction)

Stakes: the market window for an accessibility-native router closes if a generalist ships first
  Stakes type: PRACTICAL

### Solution

_seeded by C0 + the claim ladder — the curb-level routing graph is the wedge. The problem→solution warrant (WR0) is the load-bearing inference an investor will test: does "here is a pain" actually entail "therefore this product"?_

### Traction

_seeded by the support plan (§3, pending) — early pilot usage. FM-A8 (False Precision Theater) is the signature risk: the traction must be honest evidence, not a vanity metric dressed as a curve._

## 6. Objection and Dialectical Integrity Map

Objection 1 (the anti-thesis the argument must defeat): the problem is real but niche, and incumbents will fold accessible routing in before a wedge can compound
  Engaged: _pending — to be argued in the Solution + a defensibility subsection once a draft exists_

Reviewer-anticipation (the writer's pre-list; the genre layer never authors these):
  - the problem isn't urgent enough to switch
  - the solution doesn't follow from the problem
  - the traction is a vanity metric
