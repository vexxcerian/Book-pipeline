# Output Structure & Filesystem Conventions

*Reference file for the APODICTIC Development Editor. Loaded on demand at write/persist time — not during diagnostic reasoning. Holds the folder architecture, run-folder and output naming, the model-tag table, and lifecycle conventions extracted from `output-policy.md` so the always-loaded judgment file carries only editorial rules.*

---

## Folder Architecture (v0.5.0)

All APODICTIC work for a manuscript lives under a single **project root**. The `Outputs/` sibling convention from earlier versions is deprecated.

### Project Root

```
{project-root}/
├── Diagnostic_State.md          # Rolling state (updated across runs + sessions)
├── Diagnostic_State.meta.json   # Machine-readable sidecar
├── SYNTHESIS.md                 # Master revision plan (consolidated from all runs)
├── Session_Plan_{NN}.md         # Coaching session plans, numbered sequentially
├── README.md                    # Project manifest (auto-generated, see below)
└── runs/                        # Immutable run archive
    └── {run-folders}
```

`{project-root}` is the active project output context. For new projects, this is created by `/new-project`. For existing projects, it is the folder that already contains the manuscript's APODICTIC output. The project folder name should use the manuscript's working title in Title_Case with underscores (e.g., `My_Novel`, `Policy_Brief_Draft`).

**Migration from `Outputs/`:** If an existing project has an `Outputs/` folder with APODICTIC artifacts, treat that folder as the project root. Create `runs/` inside it and continue.

Never write project artifacts or rolling state files to the plugin repo, installed plugin cache, or any other APODICTIC framework directory.

### Project Registry (workspace-level)

Project roots are made **addressable** — selectable by name rather than only by being the ambient folder — through a workspace-level registry (Project Addressability, Increment 2; `docs/project-addressability.md`).

```
{workspace-root}/
├── .apodictic/
│   └── registry.json           # apodictic.project_registry.v1 (one entry per project)
├── My_Novel/                   # a project root (sidecar canonical)
│   ├── Diagnostic_State.meta.json
│   └── ...
└── Policy_Brief_Draft/         # another project root
    └── ...
```

- **Location.** `.apodictic/registry.json` in the **workspace root** — the nearest ancestor of the cwd that contains a `.apodictic/` directory (discovered by walking up, like `.git`). Not in the plugin repo/cache; `~` is not used (sandbox-unsafe).
- **Canonical vs. cache.** Each project's `Diagnostic_State.meta.json` is canonical; the registry is a *recomputable cache* of `{id, title, root, volume, denormalized mode/next_action, last_touched, series_root}`. On drift, the sidecar wins; a lost registry is rebuilt by scanning the workspace for sidecars and `*_Structural_Plan_*.md` artifacts.
- **Writers.** `/new-project` appends an entry; `/projects` lists/rebuilds/tidies; `/start <project>` binds a session to one entry's root. Pre-writing projects carry a **minimal sidecar** (`mode: diagnostic`, `next_action: pre_writing`) so they register before any Core DE run.
- **Validator.** `scripts/validate.sh registry-check <registry.json | workspace_dir>` (R1 schema, R2 root/sidecar resolution, R3 drift, R4 duplicate id).

### Rolling State Files

These files live at the project root and are updated in place:

| File | Created By | Updated By |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `Diagnostic_State.md` | `/new-project` or first DE run | Every subsequent run, coaching session, and author revision |
| `Diagnostic_State.meta.json` | `/new-project` or first DE run | Every time `Diagnostic_State.md` is updated |
| `SYNTHESIS.md` | First DE synthesis | Each subsequent run's synthesis; carries a methodology note listing contributing runs |
| `Session_Plan_{NN}.md` | `/coach` | Archived to coaching run folder on session completion; new file for each session |
| `README.md` | `/new-project` or first run | Each new run (manifest table appended) |

What does NOT live at project root: individual pass artifacts, contracts, findings ledgers, audit outputs, results guides. Those belong in `runs/`.

### Series Structure

For series projects, each volume gets its own project folder. A parent series folder holds the shared `Series_State.md`:

```
{series-root}/
├── Series_State.md
├── {Volume_One}/
│   ├── Diagnostic_State.md
│   ├── SYNTHESIS.md
│   ├── README.md
│   └── runs/
├── {Volume_Two}/
│   └── ...
```

`Series_State.md` lives at the series root, not duplicated inside each volume.

### Run Folder Naming

```
runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model-tag}_{run-type}/
```

**Date:** ISO 8601, the date the run started.

**Model tag:** Required. From the model tag table below.

**Run type:** Required. One of:

| Type | When Used |
|------|-----------|
| `full-de` | Full development edit (all 11 passes + contract audits) |
| `core-de` | Core development edit (6 passes) |
| `partial-de` | Partial manuscript diagnostic |
| `fragment-de` | Fragment synthesis |
| `audit` | Standalone audit(s) without a DE run |
| `consolidated` | Cross-model or cross-run consolidation/comparison work |
| `coaching` | Revision coaching session outputs |

**Collision rule:** If a second run of the same date + model + type occurs, append `-2` (then `-3`, etc.):
```
runs/2026-04-04_opus46_audit/
runs/2026-04-04_opus46_audit-2/
```

**Multi-model runs:** For consolidation work, use the consolidating model's tag. For swarm-mode, use the synthesis model's tag. Individual pass files still carry their own model tags per file naming rules.

### Project Manifest (README.md)

Auto-generated or updated after each run:

```markdown
# {Project Title} — APODICTIC Development Editor Files

## Start Here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SYNTHESIS.md** | Master revision plan. Open this to revise. |
| **Diagnostic_State.md** | Rolling state: findings, progress, decisions, change log. |
| **Session_Plan_{NN}.md** | Current coaching session plan. |

## Run Archive

| Folder | Date | Model | Type | Passes/Audits | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|------|---------------|-------|
| `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_model_type/` | YYYY-MM-DD | Model Name | full-de | 11 passes + N audits | ... |
```

The run archive table is append-only. Each new run adds a row.

---

## Output Naming Convention (v0.5.0)

Use these filenames within run folders:

**Core DE:**
- `[Project]_Contract_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Manuscript_Snapshot_[runlabel].md` (frozen LF-normalized copy, written at intake; the Annotated-Manuscript deliverable's immutable reference — see `run-core.md` §Intake Protocol → Step 1)
- `[Project]_Pass0_Reverse_Outline_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass1_Reader_Experience_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass2_Structural_Mapping_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass5_Character_Audit_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass8_Reveal_Economy_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Findings_Ledger_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Core_DE_Synthesis_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Annotation_Manifest_[runlabel].md` — Annotated-Manuscript deliverable, **offered at run-end** (only when a `*_DE_Synthesis_*` letter was written; see `run-synthesis.md §Annotated Manuscript + Crosslinked Letter`)
- `[Project]_Annotated_Manuscript_[runlabel].md` — the snapshot with CriticMarkup margin comments (one per finding)
- `[Project]_Crosslinked_Letter_[runlabel].md` — the editorial letter back-linked to the margin comments

**Full DE (additional):**
- `[Project]_Pass3_Rhythm_Modulation_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass4_Emotional_Value_Tracking_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass6_Scene_Function_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass7_POV_Voice_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass9_Thematic_Coherence_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass10_Entity_Tracking_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Pass11_Critical_Quality_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Diagnostic_Dashboard_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Full_DE_Synthesis_[runlabel].md`

`runlabel` format: `YYYY-MM-DD_[model-tag]`

The model tag is **required**, not optional. It identifies which model generated the analysis.

| Model family | Tag |
|-------------|-----|
| Codex 5.4 | `codex54` |
| ChatGPT o3 | `o3` |
| Gemini 3.1 | `gemini31` |
| Claude Opus 4.6 (historical compatibility) | `opus46` |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 (historical compatibility) | `sonnet46` |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 (historical compatibility) | `haiku45` |

**Examples:** `2026-03-18_codex54`, `2026-03-18_o3`

**Derivation:** Read the model identifier at runtime and derive the tag (for example, `codex-5-4` → `codex54`, `claude-opus-4-6` → `opus46`). If the model identifier is unavailable, use `unknown`.

**Multi-model runs:** Each output file carries the tag of the model that wrote it. In swarm mode where different passes run on different models, the synthesis file carries the tag of the model that wrote the synthesis.

**Partial Manuscript Diagnostic (when `artifact=partial`):**
- `[Project]_Partial_Diagnostic_[runlabel].md` (replaces `Core_DE_Synthesis`)
- All pass artifacts use standard naming but follow partial-manuscript modifications (see `references/partial-manuscript.md`)

**Fragment Synthesis (when `artifact=fragments`, goal=`draft`):**
- `[Project]_Fragment_Map_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Contract_[runlabel].md` (marked as provisional)
- `[Project]_Recommended_Spine_[runlabel].md`

**Diagnostic Vocabulary (when `operator:facilitator`):**
- `[Project]_Vocabulary_Guide_[runlabel].md` — facilitator teaching aid (glossary + discussion prompts), produced alongside the editorial letter (see `references/diagnostic-vocabulary.md`)

**Nonfiction Argument Engine (when argument-shaped):**
- `Argument_State.md` — shared argument artifact at the project root (§§1–10; see `docs/argument-state-schema.md`). The Dialectical Clarity audit populates it from a draft; the **Nonfiction Pre-Draft Pathway** seeds §1/§2/§3/§4 (+ §6 Objection 1) from `apodictic.argument_spine.v1` / `support_plan.v1` / `warrant_plan.v1` blocks *before* a draft exists (see `pre-writing-pathway/references/nonfiction-pre-draft.md`). Re-runs archive the prior state as `Argument_State_v[N].md`.
- `[Project]_Scene_Ethics_Plan_[runlabel].md` — Nonfiction Pre-Draft scene-ethics plan (Increment 4): the writer's pre-draft ethical plan for each identifiable real person depicted (`apodictic.scene_ethics.v1` — consent, handling, fairness), distinct from and cross-referencing the Legal Risk Register. See `pre-writing-pathway/references/nonfiction-pre-draft.md`.

**Legal Risk Register (when memoir / autofiction / nonfiction portrays identifiable real people):**
- `[Project]_Legal_Risk_Register_[runlabel].md` — flags legal-exposure areas (defamation / privacy / rights-clearance) with a legal-escalation severity and escalation triggers; not legal advice (see `references/legal-risk-register.md`)

**Series Continuity (when active):**
- `[Project]_Series_Continuity_Audit_[runlabel].md`

**Revision Coach (when active):**
- `[Project]_Session_Plan_[runlabel].md`
- `[Project]_Revision_Calendar_[runlabel].md` (deadline mode only)
- `[Project]_Retcon_Plan_[runlabel].md` (Retcon Planning mode — ranked Door-B candidate readings + setup-debt ledger + commitment budget; see `revision-coach/references/retcon-planning.md`)

**Rolling state files** (live at project root, not inside run folders):
- `Diagnostic_State.md` — per-volume diagnostic state at the project root. If missing, initialize from `references/diagnostic-state-template.md`.
- `Diagnostic_State.meta.json` — machine-readable sidecar at the project root. If missing, initialize from `references/diagnostic-state-meta-template.json`.
- `SYNTHESIS.md` — master revision plan at the project root. Created from the first run's synthesis; updated by subsequent runs with a methodology note listing contributing runs.
- `Series_State.md` — cross-volume series state at the series root (not inside each volume's project root). If missing, initialize from `references/series-state-template.md`. Persists across volumes; updated after each volume is analyzed.
- `[Project]_State_Card_[runlabel].md` — Retcon Planning State Card (F2), a rolling structured artifact (`apodictic.state_card.v1`, one block per round) at the project root. Diff'd across revision rounds by `validate.sh state-card-diff <prior> <current>` (Pass-10-class rolling-structured-artifact pattern). See `revision-coach/references/retcon-planning.md`.

### Results Guide

Per-run artifact, not a rolling file. Lives inside its run folder alongside the pass artifacts it references. See §Results Guide Artifact in SKILL.md for format.

### Lifecycle Summary

| Workflow | Creates Run Folder | Updates Rolling State |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `/new-project` | No (initializes project root) | Creates `Diagnostic_State.md`, `README.md` |
| `/start` (full edit) | `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model}_{type}/` | Updates `Diagnostic_State.md`, `SYNTHESIS.md`, `README.md` |
| `/audit` | `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model}_audit/` | Updates `Diagnostic_State.md`, `SYNTHESIS.md` (if findings alter plan), `README.md` |
| `/coach` | `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model}_coaching/` (on session completion) | Updates `Diagnostic_State.md` coaching log, `README.md` |
| Consolidation | `runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model}_consolidated/` | Updates `SYNTHESIS.md` (typically the most significant update), `Diagnostic_State.md`, `README.md` |

## Rolling State Updates & Machine-Readable Sidecar (Post-Synthesis)

*Extracted from `run-synthesis.md` §Core DE Deliverables. Performed at the write/persist step after the editorial letter is written.*

### Run Folder and Rolling State

All run artifacts (editorial letter, pass reports, contract, findings ledger, audit invocation log, results guide) are written to the **run folder** (`runs/YYYY-MM-DD_{model}_{type}/`) inside the project root. See `references/output-structure.md` §Folder Architecture.

After writing the editorial letter to the run folder, update the **rolling state at the project root:**

1. **Update `Diagnostic_State.md`** with:
   - Findings from this session
   - Keep / Cut / Unsure decisions
   - Control Questions
   - Change log

2. **Update `SYNTHESIS.md`** at the project root:
   - If this is the first run: copy the synthesis to the project root as `SYNTHESIS.md`
   - If prior runs exist: update `SYNTHESIS.md` to incorporate new findings, with a methodology note listing contributing runs (e.g., "Consolidated from runs: 2026-03-15_opus46_full-de, 2026-04-04_opus46_core-de")

3. **Append a row** to the `README.md` run archive table.

`Diagnostic_State.md` lives at the project root, not inside run folders. If it does not exist, create it from `references/diagnostic-state-template.md` first. Never write rolling state to the plugin repo or installed plugin cache.

### Machine-Readable Sidecar (Required)

Alongside `Diagnostic_State.md`, maintain a sidecar file `Diagnostic_State.meta.json` in the same directory. This file is machine-readable state for fast resume routing, revision coaching, and state gardening. The author never reads it; the system reads it instead of parsing the markdown when it needs structured data.

**When to write:** Initialize from `references/diagnostic-state-meta-template.json` when creating `Diagnostic_State.md`. Update the sidecar every time `Diagnostic_State.md` is updated.

**What to update:**
- `mode` and `active_scene_scope` — on every mode transition (diagnostic ↔ execution)
- `last_session` — after each session (date, focus, tier, execution_mode, passes_completed, runlabel)
- `root_causes` — after synthesis (list of root cause names, max 5)
- `triage_summary` — after synthesis (counts of must-fix, should-fix, could-fix). Required whenever `findings[]` is populated; its counts must equal the `findings[]` severity tally (`validate.sh structured-findings`).
- `findings` — after Triage/synthesis, mirror the synthesis-bound (Must-Fix/Should-Fix) ledger findings here as `apodictic.finding.v1` objects (the same locks recorded in the Findings Ledger; see `findings-ledger-format.md`). Leave `[]` only when there are no such findings.
- `audit_triggers` — after audit consolidation, mirror the ledger's `apodictic.audit_trigger.v1` records here. `[]` when none.
- `readiness` — after a readiness pass (Pass 11 / submission readiness), record `apodictic.readiness.v1` verdicts here. `[]` when not assessed.
- `control_questions` — after synthesis and after each revision round (open/answered/deferred counts)
- `revision_progress` — after each revision round (steps_complete, current_step)
- `session_count` and `handoff_count` — increment on each new session or handoff
- `state_lines` — line count of `Diagnostic_State.md` (used by state gardening to trigger archival)
- `contract_hash` — SHA-256 of the contract file, set at intake, checked at pre-pass re-grounding (see `run-core.md` §Mechanical Validation)
- `next_action.key` — enumerated dispatch key for resume routing. Valid values: `run_passes`, `run_synthesis`, `run_spot_check`, `deliver`, `revision_round`, `run_audits`, `coaching`, `handoff_reentry`. See `commands/start.md` §Resume Target for the full dispatch table.
- `next_action.description` — human-readable context for display (e.g., "resume Tier 2 passes — Pass 5 next"). Not used for routing.
