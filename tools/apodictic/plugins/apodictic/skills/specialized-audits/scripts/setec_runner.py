setec_runner.py — pass-side helper for SETEC subprocess supplementation.

Wraps the common "discover SETEC, invoke the normalized dispatcher, parse
the schema_version 1.0 envelope, classify warnings / structured errors,
return a structured result" plumbing. APODICTIC passes that bolster their
analysis with SETEC measurements (Pass 3 Rhythm/Modulation, Pass 7
POV/Voice, the AI-Prose Calibration audit, idiolect preservation, etc.)
call into this module rather than reimplementing the flow.

R2/R3 adoption (Increment 4). Every surface now routes through SETEC's
normalized dispatcher, ``setec_run.py <surface> [args] --json`` (R2): the
dispatcher resolves the surface from its capabilities manifest, enforces
the per-surface version floor + dependencies, runs the underlying script,
and **guarantees a schema_version 1.0 envelope reaches stdout for EVERY
surface** — including ``pov_voice_profile``, whose file artifact the
dispatcher projects to stdout. The consumer never touches ``--json-out``,
never allocates an ``ai-prose-baselines-private/`` tempdir, and never
scrapes stderr. A failed/blocked run is the SAME envelope with
``available: false`` plus ``reason`` + ``reason_category`` (R3); the runner
branches on ``reason_category`` to assign a tier.

The dispatcher is the SINGLE RUNTIME AUTHORITY for floor/dependency
failures (it returns R3 ``version_floor`` / ``missing_dependency``). The
consumer-side ``setec_capabilities.resolve_floor`` + the vendored manifest
are retained for the offline drift gate and capability introspection
(Increment 2's contract role), NOT as a redundant runtime pre-check that
could drift from the dispatcher.

See docs/pass3-pass7-setec-supplement-spec.md §6.6 for the design and
§6.4 for the three-tier warnings classification; the R3 ``reason_category``
-> tier mapping below extends §6.4 to structured errors.

Usage (caller builds the SETEC surface arg list; the runner routes through
the dispatcher and handles the envelope):

    from setec_runner import run_supplement

    result = run_supplement(
        "variance_audit",
        ["draft.md", "--baseline-dir", "/path/to/baseline", "--no-tier3"],
    )

    if not result.available:
        # SETEC ran but couldn't produce a measurement (R3). The reason and
        # reason_category say why; blocking_warnings carries the explanation.
        print("SETEC N/A:", result.reason_category, result.reason)
        return

    print(result.results["tier1"]["sentence_length"]["burstiness_B"])
    for w in result.reliability_warnings:
        # Render these inline near the cited measurement
        ...

    STDOUT — for ALL surfaces, including ``pov_voice_profile`` (the
    dispatcher projects its file artifact to stdout, so the consumer never
    touches ``--json-out``). There is ONE delivery path.

    ``surface`` is the normalized surface NAME (e.g. ``"variance_audit"``,
    ``"pov_voice_profile"``), NOT a script filename. The dispatcher resolves
    the surface to its script from SETEC's capabilities manifest.

    Floor / dependency enforcement is the DISPATCHER's job (R3): an
    out-of-floor or missing-dependency run comes back as an envelope with
    ``available: false`` + ``reason_category`` ∈ {``version_floor``,
    ``missing_dependency``, ...}, which this function parses and tiers (see
    the module-level mapping). The consumer does NOT pre-check the floor with
    ``resolve_floor`` here — that would double-enforce and could drift from
    the dispatcher. ``resolve_floor`` + the vendored manifest remain for the
    offline drift gate and capability introspection (Increment 2's contract
    role).

    On a SUCCESS envelope (available=True), the ``warnings`` array is
    classified per spec §6.4 into reliability / cosmetic (blocking is empty —
    a success has no blocking warning). On an ERROR envelope (available=False),
    the structured ``reason`` / ``reason_category`` drive the tier: a
    ``text_too_short`` error renders as reliability (the §6.4
    reliability-vs-blocking semantics, arriving as a structured error);
    everything else (version_floor / missing_dependency / policy_refused /
    bad_input / internal_error, and any unknown category) is blocking, with
    the reason text in ``blocking_warnings``.

    Raises ``SetecDiscoveryError`` if SETEC cannot be located, fails the
    BOOTSTRAP version-floor check, or is too old to carry the dispatcher
    (``setec_run.py`` absent — surfaced as a clean upgrade message, not a
    crash). Callers handle this as the blocking tier per spec §6.4.
