# Specialized Audit: Consent Complexity
## Version 0.4.13
*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## Purpose

This audit evaluates how consent operates in the manuscript—not to police content, but to ensure that consent complexity is handled intentionally rather than accidentally. For works that engage with dubious consent, power imbalance, conditioning, or consent as thematic territory, this audit tracks whether the narrative interrogates these elements or merely exploits them.

**When to activate:**
- Any work featuring sexual or intimate content with power imbalance
- Work exploring dubious consent, coercion, or manipulation
- Dark romance, erotic horror, or similar subgenres
- Work where consent itself is thematically significant
- Any time "conditioning," "training," or "breaking" dynamics are present
- Work featuring altered states (drugs, hypnosis, magic) affecting consent capacity

---

## Core Questions

The audit addresses these fundamental questions:

1. **Where is consent clear, ambiguous, or violated?**
2. **Does the narrative interrogate ambiguity or merely exploit it?**
3. **How does the reader's relationship to consent shift across the manuscript?**
4. **What does the work SAY about consent through its framing choices?**
5. **Is consent complexity the point (thematic exploration) or incidental (unexamined)?**

---

## Consent Clarity Levels

For every intimate or power-exchange scene, classify consent status:

### Clear Consent
- Explicit verbal agreement
- Established ongoing consent with checking-in
- Power balance between parties
- Both parties have capacity and information
- Ability to refuse is demonstrated/believable

### Ambiguous Consent
- Consent given under constraint (social pressure, obligation, fear of consequences)
- Power imbalance affecting freedom to refuse
- Mixed signals (verbal yes, body language no—or vice versa)
- Consent to one thing extended to another without renegotiation
- Altered state affecting judgment but not eliminating agency
- Consent based on incomplete information

### Violated Consent
- Explicit refusal overridden
- Capacity removed (unconsciousness, extreme intoxication, magic/drugs)
- Coercion through threat
- Deception about fundamental aspects
- Withdrawal of consent ignored

### Retconned Consent
- Initially absent or ambiguous consent reframed later as having been present
- "They wanted it really" narrative after the fact
- Characters discovering they "consented" without memory/awareness
- Post-hoc justification for violation

---

## Tracking Requirements

### Scene-Level Tracking

For each intimate or power-exchange scene, document:

**Consent Status:**
- Classification (clear / ambiguous / violated / retconned)
- Evidence for classification
- Whose perspective establishes consent status

**Power Dynamic:**
- Who has power? (Physical, social, informational, magical, institutional)
- Is the imbalance acknowledged in narrative?
- How does imbalance affect capacity to refuse?

**Information Status:**
- What does each party know?
- What are they not telling each other?
- How would full information change consent?

**Capacity Status:**
- Are parties in full capacity?
- What affects their judgment? (Drugs, magic, emotional state, conditioning)
- Is diminished capacity acknowledged?

### Character-Level Tracking

For each character involved in consent-complex dynamics, track:

**Boundaries:**
- Articulated boundaries (what they've said they want/don't want)
- Enacted boundaries (what they actually do)
- Boundary violations (theirs or others')
- Boundary shifts (changes over time and why)

**Desire vs. Consent:**
- What they want (desire)
- What they agree to (consent)
- Gaps between wanting and agreeing
- Whether they can trust their own wanting (for conditioning narratives)

**After-Effects:**
- How do they process encounters afterward?
- Aftercare present or absent?
- Psychological effects tracked?
- Is harm acknowledged within narrative?

### Reader Experience Tracking

Track how the narrative positions the reader:

**Identification:**
- With whom does reader identify? (Violator, violated, observer)
- Does identification shift?
- Is reader complicit in violation (made to desire what's harmful)?

**Information:**
- Does reader know more about consent than characters?
- Less?
- Are violations visible to reader?

**Framing:**
- How does narrative frame consent-ambiguous moments?
- As hot? Disturbing? Both? Neither?
- Are violations eroticized? Critiqued? Passed over?

## Detection Targets

### Hard Gates — Must-Fix Floor

The following four patterns are **audit-internal hard gates**. When any one fires, the finding carries an audit-internal **Must-Fix floor** that propagates to synthesis severity per the canonical Audit-Signal Propagation Rule in `core-editor/references/run-synthesis.md §Step 2`. Synthesis cannot downgrade a hard-gate flag below Must-Fix without an explicit override marker recording rationale. These gates are why Consent Complexity is at Auto-recommend before synthesis tier per `pass-dependencies.md §4a`.

- **CC-Gate-1 (Anti-Exploitation Floor):** Consent violation used for titillation without examination, victim experience invisible/minimized, and consequences avoided or minimized — the three Exploitation markers from §Exploitation vs. Exploration co-occurring in the same scene cluster.
- **CC-Gate-2 (Capacity-Bypass Floor):** Altered-state exploitation unmarked — drunk, drugged, magically-affected, or otherwise capacity-impaired character pursued without narrative acknowledgment of capacity issues.
- **CC-Gate-3 (Retcon Floor):** Violation reframed as awakening or "wanted it all along" without narrative signaling that the reframing is itself problematic.
- **CC-Gate-4 (Perpetrator-Erasure Floor / CC-6):** Violator removed from culpability frame; narrative treats the violation as something that happened *to* the violated party rather than something a perpetrator did.

A hard-gate hit produces a Must-Fix floor on the named scene cluster regardless of mode (dark romance, erotic horror, dubcon-territory) and regardless of whether the work is otherwise interrogating consent thematically. The audit's general Detection Targets below are evidence sources for the hard gates and as Note/Flag-class observations in their own right.

### Unintentional Consent Problems

**Flag when consent complexity appears accidental rather than intentional:**

1. **Unexamined power imbalance:**
   - Boss/employee, age gap, celebrity/fan dynamics presented as straightforward romance
   - No acknowledgment of how power affects consent
   - Imbalance treated as irrelevant

2. **Casual consent violations:**
   - Consent bypassed without narrative acknowledgment
   - Violations framed as romantic (surprise kiss, persistence rewarded)
   - Refusal treated as playing hard to get

3. **Missing consent moments:**
   - Escalation without any consent being established
   - Scene cuts around where consent would be negotiated
   - Consent assumed but never shown

4. **Retconning without awareness:**
   - Character discovers they "wanted it all along"
   - Violation reframed as awakening
   - Without narrative signaling this is problematic

5. **Altered state exploitation unmarked:**
   - Drunk/drugged/magically affected person pursued
   - Narrative treats this as acceptable
   - No acknowledgment of capacity issues

### Intentional But Uncontrolled Complexity

**Flag when consent complexity is attempted but not fully managed:**

1. **Thematic drift:**
   - Work starts interrogating consent, stops halfway
   - Consent complexity in some scenes but not others
   - Inconsistent framing

2. **Reader whiplash:**
   - Violent shifts in how reader should feel about consent dynamics
   - Eroticization followed by moral condemnation (or vice versa) without handling the transition

3. **Unclear authorial stance:**
   - Reader can't tell if violation is critique or endorsement
   - Ambiguity feels accidental rather than purposeful
   - "Did the author notice this is assault?"

4. **Missing consequences:**
   - Consent violations without psychological or narrative aftermath
   - Characters unbothered by what should trouble them
   - Violations narratively weightless

5. **Unearned recovery:**
   - Trauma from consent violation healed too quickly
   - Love/good sex erases harm
   - Recovery that doesn't honor what was damaged

### Exploitation vs. Exploration

**Distinguish:**

**Exploitation (often problematic):**
- Uses consent violation for titillation without examination
- Victim's experience invisible or minimized
- Power imbalance as kink without acknowledging it as power imbalance
- "It's okay because they liked it" without questioning how they came to "like" it
- Consequences avoided or minimized

**Exploration (often purposeful):**
- Consent complexity is what the work is ABOUT
- Multiple perspectives on violation present
- Psychological reality honored
- Reader made to feel complexity, not just arousal
- Consequences tracked even if ambiguous
- Work knows what it's doing and why

## Genre-Specific Considerations

### Dark Romance

Dark romance explicitly traffics in consent complexity. The audit's job is not to prohibit but to ensure intentionality.

**Track:**
- Is darkness flagged for reader? (Content warnings, genre signals)
- Does narrative maintain awareness of what's dark about it?
- Is there difference between character desire and authorial endorsement?
- Are violations framed consistently?

**Not a problem:** Explicit dubcon, noncon, power imbalance—IF intentional and consistently framed.

**Problem:** Darkness that appears without acknowledgment, violations unmarked as violations.

### Erotic Horror

Horror can use violation as horror. Erotic horror can make violation both frightening and arousing.

**Track:**
- Is violation framed AS horror? (Vs. straightforward eroticization)
- Does the work use arousal-at-violation to interrogate desire?
- Is reader's complicity part of the point?
- How does work handle reader who is both aroused and disturbed?

### Conditioning/Training Narratives

Narratives where characters are conditioned to want something raise specific consent questions.

**Track:**
- Does work acknowledge conditioning as compromising consent?
- Can character distinguish authentic from installed desire?
- Is this distinction treated as meaningful?
- How does work handle "they want it now" when "now" is post-conditioning?
- Is conditioner held accountable by narrative?

**For epistemic horror about desire:**
- Uncertainty about authentic vs. installed desire should be distressing, not resolved
- Work should maintain the horror of not knowing what you really want
- Easy answers about "true desire" undercut this horror

## Audit Output

### Consent Timeline

**Generate a chronological timeline showing how consent operates across the manuscript:**

```
| Scene/Chapter | What Consent Given | By Whom | Under What Conditions | Later Modified? | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
```

**Track consent events:**
- Initial consent establishment (if any)
- Each modification to consent (expansion, withdrawal, renegotiation)
- Each violation or boundary transgression
- Each "discovery" of consent given without awareness
- Aftercare or repair moments

**Timeline Analysis Questions:**
1. Does consent degrade, strengthen, or oscillate across the narrative?
2. Are consent negotiations front-loaded, distributed, or absent?
3. When consent is violated, is there acknowledgment and repair, or narrative silence?
4. For conditioning narratives: At what point does conditioned response replace negotiated consent?

**Example Timeline Entry (Conditioning Narrative):**
```
| Ch. 1 | Agrees to "experiment" | Protagonist | Under pressure, incomplete info | Expanded unilaterally in Ch. 3 | Initial consent limited; scope creep follows |
| Ch. 3 | No new consent given | — | Conditioned response treated as consent | — | Violation by expansion |
| Ch. 5 | Withdraws consent | Protagonist | Attempts to end | Withdrawal not honored | Memory rewritten to erase withdrawal |
| Ch. 8 | Retroactive consent | Protagonist | Discovers/accepts what was done | — | Retconning, but narratively marked |
```

This timeline makes visible what the text does with consent over time, surfacing patterns that scene-by-scene analysis might miss.

### Consent Map

Provide scene-by-scene consent classification:
- Scene location
- Consent status (clear / ambiguous / violated / retconned)
- Power dynamic notes
- Framing notes (how narrative treats it)

### Pattern Analysis

Identify:
- How does consent status shift across manuscript?
- Are violations clustered or distributed?
- Does framing remain consistent?
- Is complexity building or repetitive?
- **Consent arc:** Does the overall trajectory move toward repair, collapse, or equilibrium?

### Thematic Assessment

Evaluate:
- What does the work say about consent through its choices?
- Is this intentional (per intake)?
- Does the work know what it's doing?
- Does ending honor or betray the consent themes established?

### Specific Flags

For each flag:
- Location
- Passage reference (≤25 words)
- Issue type
- Severity

### Recommendations

Abstract structural terms per firewall:
- "This scene's consent ambiguity needs acknowledgment within narrative framing"
- "Power imbalance requires establishment before this encounter"
- "Aftermath of this scene needs psychological tracking"
- "Reader positioning shifts here without narrative support"

**NOT:** Specific reframes, rewrites, or content changes.

## Critical Distinctions

### What This Audit Is Not

1. **Not a prohibition on dark content:** Dubcon, noncon, power imbalance, conditioning—all can be explored. The audit ensures they're explored intentionally.

2. **Not a requirement for "healthy" relationships:** Fiction can depict unhealthy dynamics. The question is whether the work knows they're unhealthy.

3. **Not a demand for punishment:** Violators don't have to be punished. But violations should be visible as violations.

4. **Not an ideology test:** The audit doesn't require specific political stances on consent. It asks whether the work has a stance at all.

### The Fundamental Question

The audit ultimately asks: **Does this work handle consent complexity with intentionality and consistency, or does problematic content appear through inattention?**

Work can do almost anything with consent if it knows what it's doing.

## Integration with Core Framework

This audit runs alongside or after:
- **Pass 4 (Emotional Value Tracking):** Certainty axis applies to consent (characters uncertain whether consent was genuine)
- **Pass 5 (Character Audit):** Adds boundary and desire/consent tracking
- **Pass 8 (Reveal Economy):** How consent information is revealed to reader
- **Pass 10 (Entity Tracking):** Adds consent state tracking

Must be combined with:
- **Erotic Content tag:** If sexual content present — provides scene-level consent calculus; this audit provides the manuscript-level consent architecture
- **Romance genre module:** If romance is the parent genre
- **Horror Module:** If erotic horror or violation-as-horror present
- **Female Interiority Audit:** If female characters involved in consent complexity

*This audit is designed to bolt onto the APODICTIC development editor core framework. Activate during intake when manuscript involves power imbalance, dubious consent, conditioning, or consent as thematic territory.*
