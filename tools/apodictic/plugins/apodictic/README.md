# APODICTIC Development Editor

A development editor for fiction **and** argument-shaped nonfiction. Reads what you wrote, diagnoses structure, never rewrites — stories *or* arguments.

AI-powered developmental editing framework for fiction and persuasive/argument-shaped nonfiction (op-eds, policy briefs, testimony, essays — via the Nonfiction Argument Engine), as well as narrative nonfiction and memoir. Diagnoses structural issues through systematic passes, genre-calibrated analysis, and specialized audits. One spine — diagnose → letter → marked-up piece — two front ends.

## What It Does

The Development Editor works like a human developmental editor: it reads a manuscript or argument-shaped piece, infers what it's trying to do, and diagnoses where it succeeds or struggles. The system listens first — inferring authorial intent from the text — before measuring the work against that intent.

**For fiction:** The editor predicts the manuscript's contract (genre, reader promise, controlling idea) from the text alone. Misalignments between the inferred contract and the author's stated intent are diagnostically valuable — they reveal where the text doesn't communicate what the author intended.

**For argument-shaped nonfiction:** The engine infers the argument contract — the claim, the audience, the burden of proof, the stakes — then measures the piece against it. The Nonfiction Argument Engine flags missing warrants, scope drift, and unmet strongest objections via **Dialectical Clarity** and its Red-Team, Persuasion, and Evidence companions.

**The Firewall:** The system diagnoses problems and identifies classes of solution. It never invents content (new plot events, arguments, characters, dialogue, imagery). The author creates; the system analyzes.

## What This Plugin Does and Does Not Do

**It does:**
- Diagnose structural problems in fiction and narrative nonfiction manuscripts
- Identify where a manuscript succeeds or struggles relative to its own implied contract (genre, reader promise, controlling idea)
- Provide genre-calibrated analysis across literary fiction, horror, mystery, thriller, science fiction, fantasy, romance, and cross-genre hybrids
- Track continuity, pacing, character arcs, reveal economy, emotional dynamics, and thematic coherence across 11 systematic passes
- Run specialized audits for specific craft concerns (scene function, shelf positioning, AI-prose detection, worldbuilding integration, force delivery, and more)
- Diagnose argument-shaped nonfiction with the **Nonfiction Argument Engine** — argument spine, support, and warrant, plus Red-Team, Persuasion, and Evidence companions
- Maintain a **Legal Risk Register** that flags possible defamation, privacy, and rights exposure for a lawyer's review — it flags, never adjudicates, and is never legal advice
- **Triage feedback** and build a **beta-reader instrument** — sort and prioritize beta-reader/editor notes, and turn a diagnosis into targeted reader questions
- Render **manuscript-structure visualizations** and offer **Diagnostic-Vocabulary** and **Editor-Scaffolding** operator modes
- Keep projects addressable and resumable (`/projects`, state-driven resume), including **Retcon Planning** and **State Cards**
- Generate editorial letters, revision checklists, and diagnostic state that persists across revision rounds
- Guide pre-draft writers from idea to draftable structure

**It does not:**
- Rewrite prose, generate new scenes, invent characters, or produce creative content (the Firewall)
- Line edit, copyedit, or proofread
- Replace a human developmental editor's judgment — it provides analytical scaffolding, not verdicts
- Guarantee commercial viability, publication readiness, or literary merit
- Add telemetry or network calls of its own — the plugin transmits nothing on its own, and stores diagnostic state only on your local disk; the optional `/research` modes make web searches you invoke explicitly

The system diagnoses structure. The author creates content. After diagnosis you can stay inside APODICTIC's revision-coaching and editor workflows (session planning, stuck-point help, the revising-loop dispatcher), or step outside the diagnostic firewall to draft.

## Intended Audience

**Fiction pillar:** Fiction writers working on novels, novellas, and story collections — and by extension, narrative nonfiction, memoir, and creative nonfiction with genre-appropriate calibrations.

**Nonfiction & argument pillar:** Writers of persuasive, argument-shaped nonfiction — policy briefs, op-eds, testimony, essays, academic arguments. The Nonfiction Argument Engine diagnoses argument structure (claim ladder, warrant gaps, unmet objections, scope drift) using the same diagnose → letter → marked-up-piece spine as the fiction path.

**Secondary audiences:** Human developmental editors seeking analytical scaffolding, and writing groups using diagnostic vocabulary for structured feedback.

The plugin assumes its user is an adult working on a creative or argumentative project. Its outputs are structural diagnoses, editorial letters, and revision recommendations — analytical documents, not content.

## Components

### Workflows

**Fiction pillar:**
- **Development Edit** — The main workflow: intake protocol, 11 analysis passes, synthesis, revision rounds, genre calibration
- **Pre-Writing Pathway** — Guides writers from idea to draftable structure (no manuscript required). Writer mode calibration, seed inventory, readiness gates, option architecture, complexity budget, prospective contract, re-entry diff protocol.
- **Plot Coaching** — Plot structure diagnosis (50 spines across 12 families), selection coaching, fantasy & series architecture
- **Specialized Audits** — 37 available audits (3 universal, 19 craft, 10 genre, 5 tag), including 3 primary tags (cozy, philosophical, erotic content) and 2 companion intimacy audits; plus 6 internet-enabled research modes

**Nonfiction & argument pillar:**
- **Nonfiction Argument Engine** — Diagnoses argument-shaped nonfiction (op-eds, policy briefs, testimony, essays): infers the argument contract (claim, audience, burden, stakes), then flags missing warrants, scope drift, and unmet strongest objections. Produces an argument editorial letter and marked-up piece. Companions: Dialectical Clarity, Red-Team, Persuasion, Evidence.
- **Dialectical Clarity** (`/audit dialectical`) — Deep-dive argument structure audit: claim ladder, thesis–antithesis balance, rhetorical fairness, straw-position detection
- **Argument-Decision / ArgScope** (`/audit argument-decision`) — Structure-level argument AI-tell audit: paragraph-role arc + discourse-mode mix, per-signal contributions

**Shared:**
- **Legal Risk Register** — Flags possible defamation, privacy, and rights exposure for counsel to review. It flags, never adjudicates — not legal advice
- **Feedback Triage & Beta-Reader Instrument** — Sort, cluster, and prioritize beta-reader/editor feedback, and turn a diagnosis into targeted beta-reader questions
- **Projects** — Addressable, resumable editing projects (`/projects`, state-driven resume), with Retcon Planning and State Cards
- **Revision Coaching** — Post-diagnostic coaching: session planning, stuck-point help, momentum tracking, deadline management
- **Manuscript-structure visualizations** and **Diagnostic-Vocabulary / Editor-Scaffolding** operator modes

## Usage

### Getting Started
```
/start
```
The intake router asks what you have (idea, fragments, partial draft, complete draft, series), what you need (draft, diagnose/fix, submission readiness, AI cleanup), and any modifiers (deadline, AI-assisted text, nonfiction, editing for someone else, co-authoring). Routes you to the right workflow automatically. All other commands remain available as direct shortcuts.

### Full Development Edit
```
/start path/to/manuscript.md
```
Answer "complete draft" + "diagnose/fix" and the router runs intake, core passes (reverse outline, reader experience, structural mapping, character audit, reveal economy), and synthesis. Outputs an editorial letter, revision checklist, and diagnostic state.

### Submission Readiness
```
/ready
```
The full "is this ready?" workflow. Runs Core DE → Synthesis → Pass 11 → Compression Test and produces a unified readiness assessment with verdict, market reality check, opening conversion gate, SR code inventory, and query/synopsis diagnostic. For deadline-constrained writers, say "I'm on a deadline" during intake to get Submission Triage (single-pass go/no-go) instead.

### Quick Diagnosis
```
/start
# then answer: diagnose/fix → name one concern, e.g. "pacing in Act II"
```
A focused check on that one concern, without the full pass sequence.

### Pre-Writing Pathway
```
/pre-writing
```
For writers with an idea but no manuscript. Calibrates writer mode (architecture-first vs. discovery-first), inventories seeds, builds a protagonist engine, offers 2–3 structural candidates, sets complexity caps, and produces a Structural Plan or Minimal Viable Plan. When the writer returns with a draft, the Re-Entry Diff Protocol compares intent against execution.

### Plot Coaching
```
/plot-coach
```
Helps choose or fix a plot structure. Works for pre-drafting planning, stuck drafts, and structural pivots.

### Specialized Audit
```
/audit character
/audit shelf
/audit
```
Run a named audit or list all 37 available audits.

### Research Mode
```
/research comp
/research fact-check
```
Internet-enabled research to validate comps, check facts, verify genre currency, or surface representation context.

## Execution Modes

APODICTIC selects its execution mode based on the available context window. On models with ≥1M token context (e.g., Claude Opus 4.6), the default is **single-agent mode**: one subagent runs all passes sequentially in a single context, with the full manuscript in view throughout. This is the fastest and most token-efficient option, viable for manuscripts up to roughly 200,000 words.

For a **final-round verification pass**, request **swarm mode**: each pass runs as an independent subagent loading the full manuscript. The gain is **architectural isolation** — each pass genuinely cannot see prior analysis until reconciliation, which eliminates anchoring bias — at approximately **5x the token cost**. Best reserved for final submission prep: an earlier validation reported ~2× findings, but a 2026-06 N=1 re-test on long fiction did not reproduce a depth advantage, so swarm's dependable value is verification isolation, not everyday yield.

On standard-context models (<1M tokens), APODICTIC falls back to per-pass subagent dispatch with three tiers: **sequential** (each pass gets the full manuscript), **hybrid** (later passes get targeted excerpts via a focus map, ~2–3x cost), and **swarm** (parallel independent subagents, ~5x cost).

**When to consider each mode:**

- **Single-agent** (default on large-context models): Most manuscripts, quick diagnostics, budget-constrained runs.
- **Swarm**: Final-round diagnostics before submission, or when prior runs produced findings that echo rather than complicate each other.
- **Sequential / Hybrid**: Automatic on standard-context models; not typically needed on large-context models unless you prefer per-pass isolation.

To invoke swarm: tell the editor "run this in swarm mode" at intake.

## Model Requirements

APODICTIC is designed for and tested on **Claude Opus**. It will run on smaller models (Sonnet, Haiku), but with meaningfully degraded results — particularly in severity honesty, thematic interpretation, deliberate ambiguity handling, and fix quality. The framework includes anti-sycophancy protocols, adversarial self-checks, and severity floor rules that require strong instruction-following to work as intended. If you're evaluating the framework, use the best model available.
