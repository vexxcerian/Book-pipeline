"""Shared, hardened override-marker detection for the APODICTIC validator fleet.

The fleet's editorial gates honor an author/orchestrator escape hatch written as an HTML comment:

    <!-- override: <slug> — <rationale> -->

The naive detector — `("<!-- override: %s" % slug) in body` — has TWO proven bypasses (the
2026-06-20 sweep; the same class #128 hardened for timeline / softness):

  1. SUFFIX COLLISION   — a bare-prefix substring test matches a *longer* slug, so a marker for
                          `<slug>-but-not-really` is wrongly read as a marker for `<slug>`. (And,
                          symmetrically, a `<slug>` test fires inside `<longer-slug>`.)
  2. CODE-SPAN DECOY    — a marker quoted as a documentation EXAMPLE inside a backtick code span
                          (inline `` `…` `` or a fenced ```` ``` ```` block) is honored as if it
                          were a live directive.

`has_override` closes both for every Python site fleet-wide (centralized, so behavior is identical
everywhere) — code spans are stripped first, then the EXACT slug must be followed by a boundary
delimiter (whitespace / em- or en-dash / the comment close / EOL). This mirrors
`timeline_checks._has_override` and `honesty_check.soft_overrides` byte-for-byte in intent.

`meta_lint.py`'s M5 gate flags the bare-substring anti-pattern this module replaces, so the class
cannot silently re-enter. See docs/validator-conventions.md.

import re

# Code spans — a marker quoted inside one is a documentation EXAMPLE, not a live directive, so it is
# stripped before the override scan. CommonMark has two forms; we handle them with a small STATE MACHINE
# rather than one clever regex (successive regex patches kept breeding siblings — multiline inline spans,
# a ``` line inside a ~~~ fence, …; Codex P1 xN). `strip_code_spans` is the SINGLE source of truth — the
# bash gates delegate to it via the CLI below, so there is exactly one implementation to keep correct.
# A fence OPENER: 0–3 leading spaces (4+ or a tab is indented code, not a fence) + a run of 3+ backticks
# or tildes; group 2 is the info string (an opener may carry one). CommonMark forbids backticks in a
# BACKTICK opener's info string — that check is applied in strip_code_spans (a tilde info is unrestricted).
_FENCE_OPEN_RE = re.compile(r"^ {0,3}(`{3,}|~{3,})(.*)$")
# A fence CLOSER: in CommonMark a closing fence is ONLY the fence run + optional trailing whitespace —
# nothing else. A same-run line with other text (`~~~not-a-close`, ` ```python`) is CONTENT, not a
# closer, so it must not end the block early and expose a later marker (Codex P1).
_FENCE_CLOSE_RE = re.compile(r"^ {0,3}(`{3,}|~{3,})[ \t]*$")
# An inline span: a run of N backticks, then the shortest content NOT containing the closing run, then a
# matching run of N. DOTALL — CommonMark inline spans may contain line endings (the multiline form). A
# run with no matching close is NOT a span, so a stray backtick never over-strips.
_INLINE_SPAN_RE = re.compile(r"(`+)(?:(?!\1).)*?\1", re.DOTALL)

# After `<!-- override: <slug>` the slug must end at a real delimiter — whitespace, an em-/en-dash
# (the `— <rationale>` form), a hyphen-minus reason separator, the comment close `-->`, or EOL — so a
# SUFFIXED slug (`<slug>-extra`) does NOT satisfy a request for `<slug>`.

    vice-versa) is content, not a premature close (Codex P1). Inline spans are then removed by
    matching-length backtick runs (multiline-aware).
