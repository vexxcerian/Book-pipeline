"""reader-instrument — structural integrity for the Beta-Reader Instrument (Workflows track).

`validate.sh reader-instrument <run_folder> [--strict]` (or explicit files) shells out here.
The upstream complement to feedback-triage: it turns the diagnosis's own OPEN UNCERTAINTIES into a
targeted reader questionnaire, so the feedback that comes back is worth triaging. Each question is a
structured `apodictic.reader_question.v1` block in a Beta-Reader Instrument artifact, sourced from a
LOW/UNCERTAIN finding, an Unresolved-Questions bullet, or a finding's tradeoff (`risk_if_fixed`).
This validator owns the question-contract: schema hygiene, provenance integrity (where stable IDs
exist), the non-leading/content-neutral firewall scan, and the anti-relitigation severity gate.

  B1 invalid item        a reader_question block fails its schema (bad enum / id / missing field / JSON).
  B2 duplicate id        two questions share an RQ-NN id (ids must be unique per instrument).
  B3 provenance integrity provenance matches source_kind: low-confidence-finding/tradeoff carry a
                          `targets` that resolves to a real finding id in the Ledger and no source_note
                          dependency; unresolved-question carries a non-empty `source_note` and no targets.
                          Two advisories (WARN; ERROR under --strict): a low-confidence-finding probe
                          pointed at a non-LOW/UNCERTAIN finding (kind label disagrees with the Ledger —
                          tradeoff is exempt, it rides any finding); an unresolved-question whose
                          `source_note` matches no `### Unresolved Questions` bullet (fabricated provenance).
  B4 leading / invented   the question matches a leading construction (finite blocklist) OR introduces a
                          quoted/multi-word-capitalized phrase absent from the target finding's text
                          (coarse content-neutrality heuristic). Advisory; ERROR under --strict.
                          Override `<!-- override: leading-question RQ-NN — <rationale> -->`.
  B5 relitigating locked  a `targets` finding is LOCKED — severity in {Must-Fix, Should-Fix} AND
                          confidence in {HIGH, MEDIUM}. Testing a locked verdict by reader poll softens
                          by survey. Advisory; ERROR under --strict.
                          Override `<!-- override: how-to-fix RQ-NN — testing fix approach, not the verdict -->`.
  W1 coverage             a LOW/UNCERTAIN finding or an Unresolved-Questions bullet has no reader
                          question — a genuine uncertainty left untested (advisory; ERROR under --strict).

The instrument file (reader_question blocks) is read together with the Findings Ledger it targets
(finding blocks + the `### Unresolved Questions` section). Each is optional; an empty/absent
instrument is a no-op (no false failure). Reuses apodictic_artifacts (one block grammar + the schema
engine); the ledger index mirrors finding_trace.ledger_inventory but also keeps confidence for B5.
