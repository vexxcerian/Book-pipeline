"""finding-trace — cross-artifact Finding Lifecycle ID integrity (Harness Engineering).

`validate.sh finding-trace <run_folder> [--strict]` (or explicit files) shells out here.
Every material finding carries a durable Finding Lifecycle ID (`apodictic.finding.v1.id`,
`F-<ORIGIN>-<NN>`). `structured-findings` owns intra-ledger ID hygiene and `softness-check`
owns severity fidelity (locked -> delivered) by ID. This validator owns the *un-owned*
dimension: cross-artifact REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY + sidecar lifecycle COHERENCE.

  E1 dangling reference   a letter HTML-comment / severity_calibration citation to an
                          F-... ID that is not in the ledger (typo / phantom).
  E2 phantom sidecar      execution.finding_states key that is not a ledger ID.
  E3 invalid state        finding_states value not in {locked, delivered, revised}.
  E4 dangling revision    a revision-plan / coaching artifact cites an F-... ID not in the ledger.
  W1 lifecycle coverage   once synthesis has cleared (sidecar phase >= run_synthesis),
                          a Must-Fix/Should-Fix ledger ID with no finding_states entry
                          (advisory; ERROR under --strict).
  W2 revision coverage    a Must-Fix ledger ID not referenced in any revision plan, when one
                          is present (advisory; ERROR under --strict).
  E5 phantom completion   a completed-revision artifact MENTIONS a ledger ID whose finding_states
                          is "revised" but carries no `<!-- resolved: F-... -->` marker for it (the
                          in-scope report and the rolling sidecar disagree; IDs not in the report
                          are out of scope — a finding resolved in an earlier round is left alone).
  W3 completion coverage  a ledger ID marked resolved in a completed-revision artifact whose
                          finding_states entry is not "revised" (advisory; ERROR under --strict).
  E6 dangling retcon src  a Retcon Plan retcon_item `source` finding-ref (Retcon Planning F3,
                          primarily a Pass-8 seed) that is not in the ledger.

Each artifact is optional; a missing one skips its dimension (no false failure).
Reuses apodictic_artifacts.parse_blocks (one block grammar). See docs/finding-lifecycle-ids.md.
