"""argument-spine — structural integrity for the Nonfiction Pre-Draft Pathway (Increments 1–3 + 5).

`validate.sh argument-spine <run_folder|files>` shells out here. Before a draft exists, a writer
plans the argument: the thesis, the claim ladder, and the opposing view the argument must defeat.
That plan is one apodictic.argument_spine.v1 block, and it SEEDS the shared Argument_State.md
artifact (docs/argument-state-schema.md) — thesis -> §2 C0; subclaims -> §2 ladder; anti_thesis ->
§6 Objection 1; the §1 classification fields. The Dialectical Clarity audit fills the
draft-dependent sections later. This validator owns the pre-draft contract AND mechanizes the
seed-Argument_State integration.

  A1 invalid spine    the argument_spine block fails its schema (bad argument_type / burden_level /
                      audience_* / stakes_type enum, missing required field, <1 subclaim, bad JSON).
  A2 unseeded         a spine block is present but the artifact is not a seeded Argument_State — it
                      lacks the canonical '## 1. Context and Classification' / '## 2. Claim
                      Architecture' headings. The spine must seed the shared artifact, not float free.
  A3 thesis/C0 drift  the seeded §2 'C0 (main claim):' line does not carry the spine's `thesis` — the
                      structured spine and the human-readable Argument_State disagree.
  W1 anti-thesis echo the `anti_thesis` is empty or a normalized echo of the `thesis` (advisory;
                      ERROR --strict). A pre-draft plan must name a GENUINE opposing view, not a
                      restatement. Override: <!-- override: argument-spine-antithesis — <reason> -->.

Increment 2 — the source/evidence map, planned per subclaim as apodictic.support_plan.v1 blocks
that SEED §3 Support Map:
  A4 invalid support  a support_plan block fails its schema (bad support_type / scheme_hint / status
                      enum, malformed subclaim_id, missing field, bad JSON).
  A5 dangling subclaim a support_plan's subclaim_id is not a Cn declared in the spine's ladder.
  A6 support unseeded  support_plan blocks are present but the artifact has no '## 3. Support Map'
                      heading (the support map must seed §3 — parallel to A2).
  W2 bare assertion   once support planning has started (>=1 support_plan), a declared subclaim with
                      NO planned support (advisory; ERROR --strict). Staged, so a spine-only
                      (Increment 1) artifact is never nagged.

Increment 3 — the warrant pre-check, planned per subclaim as apodictic.warrant_plan.v1 blocks that
SEED §4 Warrant and Inference Map:
  A7 invalid warrant  a warrant_plan block fails its schema (bad warrant_status / backing / qualifier
                      enum, malformed subclaim_id, missing field, bad JSON).
  A8 dangling subclaim a warrant_plan's subclaim_id is not a Cn declared in the spine's ladder.
  A9 warrant unseeded warrant_plan blocks present but no '## 4. Warrant and Inference Map' heading.
  W3 implicit warrant for a HOSTILE audience (per the spine's audience_receptivity), a warrant that
                      is not EXPLICIT or has ABSENT backing — make it explicit and back it before
                      drafting (advisory; ERROR --strict). Audience-calibrated. Override:
                      <!-- override: argument-spine-warrant — <reason> -->.

Increment 5 — the genre layer: a genre holds itself to its GENRE-REQUIRED argument structure. One
apodictic.genre_profile.v1 block names the genre (grant-proposal / academic-article / pitch-deck) and
declares the genre-required section ROLES the pre-draft Argument_State must seed (as ### sub-headings
under the canonical §1–§6 — no new top-level section, so argument-state-schema.md stays v0.1.1):
  B1 invalid genre profile  a genre_profile block fails its schema (bad genre / evaluator / seeded_by
                      enum, empty required_sections, missing field, bad per-section shape, bad JSON).
  B2 section unseeded a declared required_sections[].heading has no matching heading in the artifact —
                      the genre's structural skeleton must be SEEDED, not merely declared (parallels
                      A2/A6/A9, the seed-don't-float-free signature).
  B3 genre/form mismatch the genre_profile.genre is incompatible with the argument_spine.form (the
                      genre and the spine disagree about what the piece is). Parallels A3 thesis/C0
                      drift. ONLY fires when a spine block is also present (a genre profile may exist in
                      an early pre-draft before the full spine; absent spine -> skip, not fail).
                      Compatibility is normalized (lowercase, collapse spaces/hyphens) so the spaced
                      doc-enum spelling ('grant proposal') matches the hyphenated genre ('grant-proposal').
  B4 duplicate genre profile  more than one genre_profile block (the piece is one genre; parallels E2).
  W4 thin genre skeleton  a declared genre's CANONICAL required section is missing from
                      required_sections (e.g. a grant-proposal that omits approach). Advisory (ERROR
                      --strict): the writer may be working a non-standard variant. Override:
                      <!-- override: argument-spine-genre <genre> — <rationale> -->.

A2/A3 (spine), B2/B3 (genre), and the seeding checks verify the plan actually populated Argument_State
(the chosen integration). Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine). An artifact with
no spine / support_plan / warrant_plan / genre_profile block is a no-op. See docs/nonfiction-pre-draft.md.
