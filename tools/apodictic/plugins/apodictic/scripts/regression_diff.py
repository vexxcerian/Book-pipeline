"""regression-diff — Draft-over-Draft Structural Regression Testing (cross-round Findings-Ledger diff).

Diffs the Findings Ledger across two revision rounds: did this revision resolve what it claimed,
and did it break anything that was working? Finding IDs are *unique per run* (renumbered each round),
so cross-round identity is established by a DETERMINISTIC heuristic match — every regression signal is
therefore a CANDIDATE for editor judgment, not a mechanical verdict. Prints classification + candidates
to stdout (the diff-validator precedent — timeline-diff / state-card-diff persist nothing); the
human-readable Regression Report is orchestrator-written at round-close.

Match rule (pinned, deterministic): a round-N finding matches a round-(N-1) finding iff same ORIGIN
code AND equal chapter token (apodictic_artifacts.chapter_token; chapter-less bins to 'unplaced' and
matches only 'unplaced') AND >=1 shared normalized mechanism token. Score = shared-token count.
Assignment is greedy + stable + one-to-one: prior findings in ascending-id order each take the
highest-scoring unconsumed current finding (tie -> lowest current NN, then lexical id).

Classes (all candidates): persisted, resolved-and-held, recurrence-candidate, new, new-in-quiet-chapter.

Validator (run-folder pair):
  R1 (ERROR)  round linkage — both ledgers resolve, parse, are non-empty, and are distinct rounds.
  W1 (WARN; ERROR --strict)  recurrence-candidate(s): a resolved/'revised' prior finding matched in N.
  W2 (WARN; ERROR --strict)  new-in-quiet-chapter(s): a current finding in a chapter the prior round
      left quiet (zero findings on record), unadjudicated. Override: `<!-- override: regression-cleared
      <runlabel>:<chapter> — investigated, not fix-induced -->`.
  W3 (WARN; ERROR --strict)  unexplained-drop: a prior finding with no current match and no resolution.
Only R1 (the diff's structural contract) is a hard error; the rest are advisory (re-diagnosing a
changed manuscript legitimately shifts findings) — the finding-trace / state-card-diff posture.

Usage:
  regression_diff.py regression-diff <prior_run_folder> <this_run_folder> [--strict]
  regression_diff.py regression-diff <run_folder>          # single round: nothing to diff (PASS)
  regression_diff.py --self-test
Exit: 0 clean / WARN-only, 1 ERROR (or WARN under --strict), 2 usage.
