# validate.sh — Mechanical validation for APODICTIC core invariants.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/validate.sh <command> [args...]
#
# Commands:
#   contract-hash <contract_file>
#       Print SHA-256 hash of the contract file (for storage in sidecar).
#
#   contract-check <contract_file> <expected_hash>
#       Verify contract file matches expected hash. Exit 0 if match, 1 if drift.
#
#   ledger-check <ledger_file>
#       Validate Findings Ledger structure. Checks that each pass entry contains
#       required sections. Reports missing sections per pass.
#
#   artifact-names <output_dir> <project_name> <runlabel>
#       Check that pass artifacts in output_dir match naming convention:
#       [Project]_Pass[N]_[Name]_[runlabel].md
#
#   synthesis-sections <editorial_letter_file>
#       Verify editorial letter contains all 11 required sections plus appendices.
#
#   state-lines <diagnostic_state_file>
#       Print line count (for state gardening threshold check).
#
#   severity-floor <editorial_letter_file> [<ledger_file>]
#       Mechanical check of the three Severity Floor Rules canonical in
#       core-editor/references/output-policy.md §Severity Floor Rules.
#       Heuristic-parse: ledger optional. Pass --self-test to run built-in cases.
#
#   audit-signal-propagation <editorial_letter_file> [<ledger_file>]
#       Mechanical check that audit-internal severity signals (Must-Fix floors,
#       hard gates, HIGH ratings) propagate to synthesis-layer Must-Fix /
#       Should-Fix per the canonical rule in
#       core-editor/references/run-synthesis.md §Step 2 — Canonical
#       Audit-Signal Propagation Rule. Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   underdiagnosis-triggers <editorial_letter_file> [<ledger_file>]
#       Detect the six enumerated underdiagnosis triggers canonical in
#       core-editor/references/run-synthesis.md §Step 9 (Conditional
#       Underdiagnosis Retry Loop). For each fired trigger, the synthesis
#       layer must either upgrade the affected finding or document an
#       override via marker <!-- override: underdiagnosis-trigger-<id> -->
#       in the letter body. Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   ledger-consolidation <consolidated_ledger_file> [<raw_ledger_file>]
#       Mechanical check that a consolidated Findings Ledger satisfies the
#       canonical Findings Ledger Consolidation Contract in
#       core-editor/references/run-synthesis.md §Step 2. Verifies that raw
#       pass headers do not appear in unbroken concatenation, that
#       cross-pass convergence is annotated, that severity collation is
#       documented, and (if raw provided) that consolidation reduced entry
#       count by ≥30%. Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   decision-layer-check <editorial_letter_file>
#       Mechanical check of Decision-Layer Consolidation counts and
#       Mandatory Appendices presence per
#       core-editor/references/run-synthesis.md §Step 7 and
#       core-editor/references/output-policy.md §Mandatory Appendices /
#       §Evidence Density Self-Check. Verifies Protected Elements (3-6),
#       Author Decisions (3-7), Control Questions (exactly 7), Appendices
#       A/B/C present, and per-Must-Fix evidence density (≥2 references).
#       Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   author-facing-lint <editorial_letter_file>
#       ADVISORY (warn-only) lint of author-facing language per
#       core-editor/references/output-policy.md §Author-Facing Language.
#       Surfaces framework shorthand — pass codes (Pass 11F), [.. CONFIDENCE]
#       tags, QF-/CR-/FM- finding codes, P0-P5 tier labels — used as an
#       un-glossed PRIMARY LABEL in the synthesis body. Appendices are exempt;
#       a code glossed inline on first use ("plain language (CODE)" or
#       "CODE (gloss)") is exempt; only the first use of each code is judged.
#       Every hit is a WARN — the arm NEVER fails the build (exit 0); promote to
#       a gate once proven quiet. Body override marker:
#       <!-- override: author-facing-lint -->. Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   quality-risk-triggers <contract_file> [<diagnostic_state_meta_file>]
#       Detect the five enumerated quality-risk mode-selection triggers
#       canonical in core-editor/references/run-core.md
#       §Quality-Risk Mode Selection. Reads contract artifact for genre,
#       audit recommendations, darkness level, POV count, structural notes,
#       and submission-readiness signals. Reads Diagnostic_State.meta.json
#       (if present) for prior-run thin-synthesis flags (Q4). Emits the
#       fired Q1-Q5 trigger set, the per-trigger rationale, and the
#       recommended escalation target (hybrid or swarm). Override marker
#       support: <!-- override: quality-risk-Q[1-5] — <rationale> --> in
#       contract or sidecar markdown notes. Pass --self-test for built-in
#       cases.
#
#   timeline-diff <prior_timeline> <current_timeline>
#       Surface every event added/removed/changed and every anchor changed
#       between two Timeline.md artifacts (Pass-10-Class rolling structured
#       artifact per core-editor/references/pass-10.md). Exit 0 if Section 8
#       (Diff Notes) of the current Timeline annotates each diff or no diff
#       exists; exit 1 if undocumented diff present. Honors body-only
#       override marker <!-- override: timeline-diff-undocumented -->.
#       Pass --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   timeline-arithmetic <timeline_file>
#       Marker-hygiene check only (v1.7.9 honest reframing). Surfaces
#       rows with a negative gap-from-previous numeric value or with
#       a pre-labeled "(conflicts ...)" / "(contradicts ...)" parenthetical.
#       Does NOT independently compute span arithmetic — true arithmetic
#       verification (span sums, anchor-format normalization) requires
#       structured Timeline parsing and is deferred to a Phase 7 Python
#       helper. Exit 0 if no marker-hygiene candidates; exit 1 if surfaced.
#       Honors body-only override marker
#       <!-- override: timeline-arithmetic-conflict -->. Pass --self-test
#       for built-in cases.
#
#   timeline-anchor-conflict <timeline_file>
#       Pre-labeled-conflict surfacing only (v1.7.9 honest reframing).
#       Counts parenthetical "(contradicts ...)", "(paradox with ...)",
#       and "(conflicts with ...)" annotations in the Timeline body —
#       i.e., Pass 10 model judgment has already pre-labeled the conflict.
#       Does NOT independently parse temporal anchors per scene/chapter
#       and reason about same-anchor-different-time conflicts; true
#       anchor-format parsing is deferred to a Phase 7 Python helper.
#       Exit 0 if no candidates; exit 1 if candidates surfaced. Honors
#       body-only override marker
#       <!-- override: timeline-anchor-conflict -->. Pass --self-test for
#       built-in cases.
#
#   audit-tier-criterion <pass_dependencies_file> [<audits_root_dir>]
#       Verify audit tier assignments in pass-dependencies.md §4a/§4b
#       satisfy criterion 1 (named hard gates / Must-Fix floor) of the
#       §4c Audit Tier Promotion Criteria for any audit at Hard
#       Prerequisite / Pre-DE Prerequisite / Auto-run / Auto-recommend
#       before synthesis tier. Criteria 2 (undetectable-by-passes) and
#       3 (disclosure-non-equivalence) require model judgment and are
#       not mechanically verified. Per-audit override marker:
#       <!-- override: audit-tier-criterion-<audit-slug> -->. Pass
#       --self-test for built-in cases.
#
#   argument-recon-prerequisite <run_folder> [<editorial_letter_file>]
#       Verify argument-shaped runs satisfy the Field Reconnaissance
#       prerequisite per pass-dependencies.md §4a (Hard Prerequisite or
#       Auto-recommend before synthesis) and v1.7.9 wiring. When
#       argument-engine artifacts (Argument_State.md, Red_Team_Memo.md,
#       Argument_Evidence.md, etc.) are present in the run folder, the
#       validator requires either (a) Field_Reconnaissance_Report.md in
#       the run folder, or (b) the canonical blind-spot disclosure
#       ("literature-counterevidence not surveyed") in the editorial
#       letter per run-synthesis.md §Step 3. Body-only override marker:
#       <!-- override: argument-recon-prerequisite -->. Pass --self-test
#       for built-in cases.
#
#   structured-findings <file> [<file>...]
#       Validate embedded apodictic:* JSON blocks (apodictic.finding.v1,
#       audit_trigger.v1, readiness.v1) in ledger/letter markdown and the
#       Diagnostic_State.meta.json sidecar (findings[] severities must tally to
#       triage_summary). Delegates to scripts/structured_findings.py (real JSON
#       parser); degrades to a presence check without python3. Pass --self-test
#       for built-in cases.
#
#   softness-check <editorial_letter> <findings_ledger>
#       Deficit-Lock softness gate (Phase 4). Compares the delivered letter
#       against the Triage-locked apodictic.finding.v1 findings in the ledger;
#       ERROR on an unmarked downgrade/drop of a locked Must-Fix/Should-Fix,
#       WARN on hedged delivery. Body-only override marker:
#       <!-- override: softness-downgrade — <rationale> -->. Weak-axis coherence
#       stays in severity-floor. Delegates to scripts/honesty_check.py.
#
#   deficit-lock <findings_ledger>
#       Verify the Deficit Lock was recorded structurally (ledger carries
#       apodictic.finding.v1 locks). Delegates to honesty_check.py. Pass
#       --self-test for built-in cases.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all checks pass
#   1 — validation failure (details on stdout)
#   2 — usage error

# Shared hardened override-marker detection (2026-06-20 override-substring class).
#
# The bash gates honor an author/orchestrator escape hatch `<!-- override: <slug> — <rationale> -->`.
# The legacy `grep -F "<!-- override: <slug>"` bare-prefix test had two proven bypasses (the same the
# Python `override_marker.has_override` helper closes, so both arms accept the SAME marker set):
#   1. SUFFIX COLLISION — a bare-prefix match honors a longer slug (`<slug>-but-not-really`).
#   2. CODE-SPAN DECOY  — a marker quoted as documentation inside a backtick span — inline `` `…` `` OR
#                         a fenced ```...``` block — is honored as if live. (Group 4: the old per-line
#                         `sed` stripped inline only, so a marker inside a FENCED block was honored by
#                         bash though the Python path rejected it — bash was wrongly MORE permissive.)
# `_has_override <slug>` reads the body on stdin, strips fenced code blocks (awk fence toggle) AND
# inline code spans (sed), then requires the EXACT slug followed by a boundary delimiter — whitespace,
# an em-/en-dash, the comment close `-->`, or EOL — mirroring the Python helper. Whitespace after
# `<!--` and `override:` is flexible to match Python's `\s*`. Returns 0 (found) / 1 (not found).
# meta_lint.py's M5 gate flags the legacy bare-substring AND compiled/inline-regex forms (and M6 flags a
# local code-span stripper), so the override-bypass class cannot re-enter.

  #           at Partial Fit (no "publishable as-is"-tier verdicts).

  #   Propagation Rule. Per-audit operationalization in

  #   core-editor/references/output-policy.md §Evidence Density
  #     Self-Check — ≥2 references per Must-Fix.
  #
  # Verifies five mechanical checks:
  #   1. Protected Elements — 3-6 entries (count list items / paragraphs
  #      under the "Protected Elements" heading; argument-DE variant
  #      "Strengths / Protected Elements" or "Coalition-Partner
  #      Ground-Truth Recommendations" also accepted — see C3 below).
  #   2. Author Decisions — 3-7 entries (count Keep/Cut/Unsure subhead
  #      clusters when subheads present, or list items under the heading
  #      otherwise; see C1 below).
  #   3. Control Questions — exactly 7 entries (skipped for argument-DE
  #      class; see C3 below).
  #   4. Mandatory Appendices A, B, C — each present as a heading with a
  #      non-empty body (skipped for argument-DE class; see C3).
  #   5. Must-Fix evidence density — every Must-Fix entry has ≥2
  #      references in a paragraph-block window scanning until next
  #      Must-Fix or section header (see C4 below).
  #
  # Phase 7 Wave 1 calibration (C1-C4 from Phase 4 Wave 3 eval coverage):
  #   C1 — When the Author Decisions section has Keep/Cut/Unsure subheads,
  #        count subhead clusters (3) rather than the sub-bullets within
  #        them. The contract intent is "3-7 distinct decision categories"
  #        and Keep/Cut/Unsure naturally produces 2-3 categories with
  #        sub-bullets as evidence. Subhead-cluster mode is detected when
  #        any of `### Keep`, `### Cut`, `### Unsure` headings appears
  #        within the Author Decisions section.
  #   C2 — When neither list items nor bolded paragraphs are detected,
  #        fall back to paragraph-form detection: count blank-line-
  #        separated paragraphs whose first sentence begins with one of
  #        the canonical decision verbs (Protect, Keep, Cut, Defer,
  #        Decide, Unsure) or contains an opening bolded keyword
  #        (`**Decision:**`, `**Question:**`). Risk-controlled fallback —
  #        only fires when the first two heuristics return zero.
  #   C3 — Detect argument-DE letter class via marker presence:
  #        "Coalition-Partner Ground-Truth Recommendations",
  #        "Editorial-Dispute Territory", "Argument_State", "Claim

## What Needs Work
Must-Fix: voice drift in Chapter 3 (lines 80-95) and Chapter 7 (lines 200-215).
## Protected Elements
Protect the dual-narrator structure across Parts I and II. The shifting POV is the book's load-bearing architecture and revision should not flatten it.

Protect the slow opening in Chapter 1. Its pacing rewards the patient reader and survives multiple test passes without losing tension.

Protect the sibling reconciliation in Chapter 11. This is the emotional spine of the closing third and any cut here will undo the climax.

Protect the metafictional epigraph. It cues the unreliable-narrator frame readers need.

## Author Decisions
Keep the prologue. The distance frame it establishes is doing work the body cannot do without it.

Cut the third dream sequence. It duplicates the second and dilutes thematic charge.

Decide whether Chapter 5 stays in Part I. The decision determines whether Part I lands on the sister scene or the road scene; both are defensible but only one survives.

Unsure on the chapter break between 7 and 8. Either an explicit break or a soft fade works structurally; this is a craft decision the author owns.

## What Needs Work

## Coalition-Partner Ground-Truth Recommendations
- Center the lived-experience testimony in §2 before introducing the statistical frame in §3.
- Cite the 2024 longitudinal study (page 8) before pivoting to policy implications in §4.
- Replace the abstract case in §6 with the named program example partners flagged.
- Re-sequence §7 conclusions to lead with coalition-partner recommendations rather than authorial conclusions.
## Editorial-Dispute Territory
Decide whether the methodology critique in §4 stays at its current scope. Reviewers split on this — three readers wanted it expanded to address replication failures; two wanted it cut as scope creep.

Cut the second example in §6 if the methodology critique stays at current scope; keep it if the methodology critique expands.

Defer the call-to-action framing decision until after Field Reconnaissance returns. The literature-counterevidence may shift the policy frame.

Decide whether the regulatory recommendations in §8 belong in the body or in an annex. Argument_State analysis suggests body placement strengthens the claim ladder.

Decide on the executive summary's length cap (current 1 page; partner asked for 2).

Hostile-reader attack 1: scope creep in §4.
Hostile-reader attack 2: cherry-picked sample in §3 (lines 320-340 vulnerable).

## What Needs Work

Must-Fix: pacing collapse in the middle third.

The Compression audit flagged this at Pattern severity — see Chapter 7 (lines 142-160) where the text summarizes three days in two sentences while the surrounding scenes operate at scene-level granularity. The same compression appears in Chapter 9 around line 220, and the Compression audit's §7 hard gate fires on the cumulative pattern. Page 88 contains the load-bearing scene that should anchor the middle third's pacing recovery; instead it's compressed into a paragraph.

Must-Fix: voice drift in Chapter 3.

Scene 4 (line 95) shows the first drift; the AI-Prose Calibration audit flagged AIC-2 voice flattening at Pattern severity. The drift recurs at Chapter 5 line 180 and Chapter 7 lines 200-215, producing a manuscript-wide pattern the audit elevated from Spot to Pattern.

  # MARKER HYGIENE CHECK ONLY (v1.7.9 honest reframing).
  #
  # This validator does NOT independently compute span arithmetic. True
  # arithmetic verification requires structured Timeline parsing — date
  # math across heterogeneous anchor formats ("Day 1 morning", "the
  # following Friday", "January 14"), span normalization, and overlap
  # detection — which is not feasible in bash. That work is deferred to
  # a Phase 7 Python helper.
  #
  # What this validator actually does:
  #   (a) Surfaces rows whose gap-from-previous cell carries a negative
  #       numeric value (text matching /\|[[:space:]]*-\d+/ in a pipe-row).
  #       This catches the visible-after-revision case where the author
  #       has already noticed the ordering broke and recorded the
  #       negative gap explicitly.
  #   (b) Surfaces rows that carry an in-line "(conflicts ...)" or
  #       "(contradicts ...)" parenthetical — i.e., the Pass 10 model
  #       has already pre-labeled the conflict.
  #
  # What this validator does NOT do (Phase 7 work):
  #   - Independently compute that "Day 1 morning + 30-hour span" is
  #     incompatible with "Day 1 afternoon" being the next scene.
  #   - Detect anchor conflicts that the Pass 10 model failed to pre-label.
  #   - Normalize anchor formats and reason about elapsed time.
  #
  # Real arithmetic violations that pass through unflagged include any
  # case where the model wrote consistent-looking pipe rows whose spans
  # don't actually sum. Pass 10 model judgment is still the primary
  # classifier; this validator is a safety net for the cases where the
