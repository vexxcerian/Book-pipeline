"""persona-divergence — structural integrity for Reader-Persona Simulation.

`validate.sh persona-divergence <run_folder|files>` shells out here. Pass 1 maps the experience of
ONE composite reader; a manuscript meets an audience with different tolerances. Persona simulation
runs the reader-experience lens through several declared reading DISPOSITIONS and surfaces where the
predicted experience DIVERGES — divergence is the diagnostic signal, as contract-mismatch is. This
validator owns the divergence-prediction contract and the three mechanical guards that keep it a
LENS, never the non-viable Simulated Reader Focus Group (Horizon item 17): predictions are grounded
(D2), personas are closed-key disposition vectors (D5), and fabricated testimony is scanned (D4).

  D1 schema            a persona / divergence block fails its schema (bad disposition enum, bad
                       target type, malformed P-NN / D-NN id, missing anchor/magnitude/experiences,
                       broken JSON, duplicate id); a nested `experiences` value is not one of
                       engaged|neutral|friction|disengage, or names a persona id that was not declared.
  D2 grounded          a divergence `anchor` resolves to NEITHER a real apodictic.finding.v1 id in the
     prediction       Ledger NOR a real Timeline scene id (locus). An ungrounded prediction is a
                       fabricated one — the signature firewall gate (ERROR).
  D3 target-severity   not exactly one persona is target:true; OR a divergence's optional
     anchoring         `asserted_severity` DIFFERS FROM its anchored finding's locked Ledger severity,
                       OR is asserted on an anchor with NO locked severity (a Timeline locus). The
                       overlay is descriptive: a severity may be asserted only against a Ledger finding
                       whose locked severity it equals — neither downgrade NOR inflate (ERROR).
  D4 no fabricated     the map presents a first-person reader-reaction QUOTE ("I got bored …") as data
     testimony        — invented reader testimony, the #17 boundary. Advisory; ERROR under --strict.
                       Override: <!-- override: persona-quote D-NN — quoting the manuscript -->, where
                       D-NN must be a DECLARED divergence id (a bogus id does not silence the scan).
  D5 disposition,      a persona block carries ANY key outside {schema, id, target, the five
     not character     disposition axes} — a persona is a parameterization, never an invented
                       character. A closed-key ERROR, NON-overridable (one of the three #17 guards;
                       the subset engine silently allows unknown keys, so this is the real guarantee).
  W1 coverage          fewer than two personas, or no disposition axis varies across them — there is no
                       contrast for divergence to surface. Advisory; ERROR under --strict.

The map (persona + divergence blocks) is read with the Findings Ledger (anchor resolution + locked
severities) and optionally the Timeline (locus anchors). Reuses apodictic_artifacts. See
docs/reader-persona-simulation.md.
