"""style-explanation — structural integrity for the Interpretable Stylometric Explanation overlay.

`validate.sh style-explanation <author_root|files>` shells out here. The Author Voice Fingerprint
(#9) measures how distinctive a writer's voice is and persists it across a career — but only as
NUMBERS. This capability is the LABELLING LAYER: it attaches a natural-language description to an
already-measured stylistic feature ("the prose leans hard on the definite article", "function-word
profile concentrated in the/and/but"), each label bound by provenance to the exact measured feature
it glosses. It is a reading aid for the fingerprint, not a new measurement and not advice. It does NO
new stylometry — it CONSUMES the SETEC voice_profile per-family feature inventory
(families.<family>.top_features[].{feature, mean, sd, cv}) and adds only the LABEL text plus its
binding back to a measured feature. Each label is an apodictic.style_label.v1 block.

The module is strictly DESCRIPTIVE. The whole design is built so the prescriptive sentence ("write
more like X", "vary your function-word profile") is UNREPRESENTABLE in the structured fields — there
is no target/goal/recommendation/rewrite/compare_to_author field, `frame` and `direction` admit only
descriptive values — and the one residual free-text surface (`label`) is scanned by X4. The profile is
local-only (no external call). It is the riskiest of its wave: one preposition from a Firewall breach.

  X1 schema        a style_label block fails its schema (bad feature_family/frame/direction/magnitude
                   enum, malformed SL-NN id, missing required field, broken JSON, or a duplicate id).
                   ERROR.
  X2 provenance    a label whose `feature_ref` is empty or absent — a style claim with no measured
                   feature behind it is treated as FABRICATED and rejected (the module consumes; an
                   un-sourced label can't be traced — the #9 F2 / centroid_ref discipline). ERROR.
  X3 no-severity   the reader-facing prose or any `label` carries an editorial Must/Should/Could-Fix
                   token, OR an apodictic:finding block is present in the artifact. A style label is
                   not a defect (the Content-Advisory A3 orthogonal-severity discipline). ERROR.
  X4 descriptive   a `label` or the visible prose matches a PRESCRIPTIVE construction aimed at the
                   voice (a modal/imperative verb governing a style change) OR a COMPARISON-TO-EMULATE
                   construction ("write/sound more like …", "emulate …", "model your prose on …"). The
                   bare descriptive adjective ("the prose is terse", "elevated use of the definite
                   article") does NOT fire — only the directive. Advisory; ERROR under --strict.
                   Override per id: <!-- override: style-frame SL-NN — <why> --> (label-level matches);
                   the bare <!-- override: style-frame — <why> --> silences prose-level (non-id) matches
                   — the Content-Advisory W1 prose-vs-label split.
  X5 same-register a `describes-cluster` label referencing >= 2 labels (a cluster claim) whose
                   referenced labels do not all share a `register` — a cross-register cluster is a
                   comparability error the AI-prose domain-shift caution forbids (the #9 F3 shape).
                   ERROR.
  X6 local-only    the artifact lacks a `<!-- author-style-explanation: local-only -->` marker, or it
                   references an external http(s) URL — a labelled voice profile must never be
                   transmitted. Advisory WARN ONLY, never escalated under --strict (a self-attestation
                   hygiene check; the binding guarantee is the module's no-external-call rule, #9 W2).
  W1 seed/coverage no style_label blocks resolved => no-op; OR only one feature glossed => the overlay
                   is thin. Advisory; ERROR under --strict for the THIN case only, never the no-op.

Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine). The labels live in #9's existing
Author_Voice_Profile.md (composing with voice_fingerprint blocks) OR a sibling
Author_Style_Explanation*.md; the resolver handles both via parsed-block detection. The
embedding/scoring model that GENERATES the labels is a deferred M2 lazy-import + skipif seam — this
M1 validator never calls a model and enforces the firewall regardless of who authored the labels.
