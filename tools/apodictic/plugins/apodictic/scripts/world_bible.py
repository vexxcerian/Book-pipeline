"""world-bible — structural integrity + contradiction detection for a standalone Worldbuilding Bible.

`validate.sh world-bible <run_folder|files>` shells out here. A worldbuilding bible is the SFF
author's OWN pre-draft reference document — the rules of the magic/tech, the cost of using it, the
geography, the order of events, the factions. Before a single chapter exists, that bible can already
contradict itself. This tool checks a BIBLE (not a manuscript) for that class of self-contradiction —
closed-set rule consistency, magic-system cost accounting, geography/timeline contradiction — and
SURFACES the contradictions the bible has already committed to. It never invents world content, fills
an unstated gap, or resolves a conflict (the Firewall: extract the stated, never author the unstated).
Each fact is an apodictic.world_fact.v1 block; this validator owns the bible's contract and the three
contradiction arms.

  W1 schema           a world_fact block fails its schema (bad category/polarity enum, malformed
                      WF-NN id, missing required field, unquoted-numeric value, empty loci, broken
                      JSON) OR carries an unknown (closed-key) field — a misspelled key the subset
                      schema engine would otherwise admit silently (so the closed-set guarantee is
                      not hollow).
  WD duplicate id     two facts share a WF-NN id (the W-class id-uniqueness check).
  WB-R1 rule          two `rule` facts on the same subject + same normalized value assert opposite
                      polarity (can vs cannot, or requires vs cannot) — a literal closed-set
                      contradiction. ERROR. Override <!-- override: world-rule WF-NN/WF-MM — … -->.
  WB-C1 cost          two `cost`/cost-bearing-`rule` facts on the same subject assign two different
                      non-null, non-"none" cost values — the bible prices the same power two ways.
                      ERROR. Override <!-- override: world-cost WF-NN/WF-MM — … -->.
  WB-C2 free-vs-costed  the same subject is stated free (cost null/"none") in one fact and carries a
                      real cost in another — the pre-draft form of Cost Amnesia. Advisory WARN;
                      ERROR under --strict. Override <!-- override: world-cost WF-NN/WF-MM — … -->.
  WB-G1 distance      the same unordered {subject, pair_subject} edge is assigned two different parsed
                      distances WITHIN ONE commensurable unit class (spatial: mile/league/km;
                      temporal-travel: day/hour). The two axes never collide-check against each other
                      (a 6-day ride and 120 miles can both be true). ERROR. Override
                      <!-- override: world-geo WF-NN/WF-MM — … -->.
  WB-G2 chronology    the directed `event` edges (subject happens-before pair_subject) contain a CYCLE
                      (X<Y, Y<Z, Z<X), OR the same event is stated at two different absolute day
                      anchors (Day N). An unresolvable timeline contradiction. ERROR. Override
                      <!-- override: world-geo WF-NN/WF-MM — … --> (cycle: name any two ids on it).
  WF (firewall)       a reader-facing prose scan: a resolution/invention verb ("the true rule is",
                      "the canonical cost is", "should be N miles") leaking into the bible's prose —
                      the tool SURFACES, it never resolves. Advisory WARN; ERROR under --strict.
                      Override <!-- override: world-firewall — <rationale> -->.

`value` is ALWAYS a string (numerics quoted) so W1 can type-check + the arms can parse it. The three
arms are deterministic, stdlib-only, and CONSERVATIVE: they fire only on confidently parseable,
literally-colliding facts; ambiguous / unparseable / cross-axis / non-literal (implied) contradictions
are left to the author and never become a hard failure. Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar +
schema engine). Each artifact is optional; an empty/absent one is a no-op. See docs/worldbuilding-bible.md.

# with no `polarity` is skipped by WB-R1; a `distance` with no `pair_subject` by WB-G1; a `cost` with
# no `cost` by WB-C1/C2). That makes an arm "look clean" over a malformed bible. These checks close the
# hole so the keyed field is enforced at W1, mirroring the closed-key + cost-type bespoke passes. Each
# arm was read to derive its category->field pair (review finding P1, round 9):

#   distance -> pair_subject (WB-G1 keys on the unordered {subject, pair_subject} edge)

#                             needs pair_subject; the anchor-drift check needs a parseable Day/Week in
