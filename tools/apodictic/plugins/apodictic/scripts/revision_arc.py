"""revision-arc — structural integrity for Multi-Session Revision Arc Planning (Coaching Deepening).

`validate.sh revision-arc <run_folder> [--strict]` (or explicit files) shells out here. The
revision-coach reads the diagnostic state and SEQUENCES the Findings Ledger into a phased
multi-week strategy — Phase 1 structural root causes -> Phase 2 downstream consequences ->
Phase 3 polish — recorded as a single `apodictic.revision_arc.v1` block (one arc per manuscript).
It is the layer ABOVE the per-session Loop Dispatch: the arc is the calendar that sequences
findings into per-session planning; it does not re-run dispatch, and it generalizes Retcon
Planning's single-decision arc to the full Ledger.

THE HONEST POSTURE (load-bearing — the Retcon pattern: the coach infers, the validator gates the
PLAN). The Root-Cause mapping is NOT machine-readable (finding.v1 carries only structured
`severity`; the diagnostic-state Root-Cause map is markdown prose). So this validator gates the
arc's **provenance + self-consistency + firewall ONLY** — it does NOT verify the arc against a
true causal graph, and it never re-judges severity, re-validates root causes, or rates leverage-
optimality. The coach's dependency reasoning (which finding is upstream of which) is TRUSTED, not
gated. A3 is a SELF-CONSISTENCY check over the arc's OWN structure (the co-presence present-vs-
mentioned precedent), never a correctness check against the Ledger's real dependency structure.

  A1 invalid arc      the revision_arc block / a phase object fails its shape: bad/missing schema,
                      no phases, an empty phase (`findings` must have >=1 ref), a finding_ref that
                      isn't a finding.v1 id (^F-[A-Za-z0-9]+-[0-9]{2,}$), a non-string phase_label
                      / rationale / adaptation_note, a root_cause_findings member not in that
                      phase's findings, or invalid JSON.
  A2 provenance       every finding_ref in the arc resolves to a real finding.v1 id in the Findings
                      Ledger (a dangling ref is an error, mirroring finding-trace E1/E4). The arc
                      invents no findings. (Skipped only when NO ledger is in scope — then A2 is a
                      no-op and the absence is reported, never a silent pass.)
  A3 self-consistency (NOT a causal-graph check.) Each finding_ref appears in EXACTLY one phase
                      across the arc (no finding in two phases); and a finding the arc itself
                      labels a structural root cause (a `root_cause_findings` member) whose Ledger
                      severity is Must-Fix is NOT parked in the LAST (polish) phase — the leverage
                      check over the STRUCTURED severity enum + the arc's OWN phase ordering. This
                      verifies the arc's internal consistency, never that its phasing matches the
                      Ledger's true causal structure (that is the coach's trusted reasoning).
  A4 rationale        every phase carries a non-empty `rationale` (the sequencing 'why').
  W1 firewall drift   a phase rationale that prescribes EXECUTION (invents the prose/scene that
                      resolves a finding) rather than sequencing it — reuses the retcon-plan
                      firewall-drift heuristics. ADVISORY / best-effort (pattern-based: known
                      false-negatives — a rationale can prescribe execution in language the
                      heuristics don't catch); ERROR under --strict. The Firewall line: the arc
                      sequences findings; the author writes the tissue.
  W2 orphan finding   a Must-Fix Ledger finding absent from the arc — a high-leverage fix the
                      multi-week strategy doesn't sequence (advisory; ERROR under --strict).

Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine), finding_trace.ledger_inventory (the
authoritative Ledger ID set, shared so provenance can't drift), and the retcon_plan firewall-drift
regexes (shared so the Firewall heuristic is single-sourced across the two coaching tracks). Each
artifact is optional; an empty/absent one is a no-op. See docs/multi-session-arc-planning.md.
