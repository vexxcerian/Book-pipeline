"""reanchor — Annotated-Manuscript round-trip re-anchoring (carry the margin notes across a revision).

Given draft N's gated annotation manifest (a prior run folder) and draft N+1's snapshot, re-resolve each
annotation against the new snapshot and classify what happened — making the annotated copy revision-aware
and feeding ANCHOR/TEXT-level evidence into regression-diff (the finding-level cross-round diff). Pure text
search over the new snapshot — it invents nothing: a re-anchored quote must occur verbatim and exactly once
in N+1 (the A6 identity, reused), the offset is RECOMPUTED against N+1 (never carried forward), and the
margin comment is carried over byte-identically (never re-authored).

Classes (an exhaustive, mutually-exclusive partition of draft-N's annotations — RA3):
  held              the span resolves to the SAME locus in N+1 (quote verbatim+unique at the same offset;
                    chapter/section heading present+unique; document always held).
  moved             (quote only) the quote resolves verbatim+unique but at a NEW recomputed offset.
  vanished          the span no longer occurs in N+1 (quote absent; heading gone) — candidate resolved.
  ambiguous         the span now occurs >1 time in N+1 (quote/heading duplicated) — re-anchor refused.
  not-re-anchorable (line-range only) bare line numbers carry no text to search — refused by design.

Validator (run-folder + new snapshot):
  RA1 (ERROR)  re-anchor integrity: the emitted re-anchored manifest (held/moved only, bound to N+1)
       passes the structural A-gate against N+1 (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4-multiset + A6; A4/A5 ledger arms do
       not apply — there is no re-diagnosed N+1 ledger).
  RA2 (ERROR)  comment fidelity: every carried-over comment is byte-identical to its draft-N manifest
       comment (the firewall: relocate, never re-author — and A6(a)'s projection arm is inert here).
  RA3 (ERROR)  partition completeness: every draft-N annotation lands in exactly one class.
  W1 (WARN; ERROR --strict)  candidate-resolved: one or more `vanished` annotations.
  W2 (WARN; ERROR --strict)  re-anchor refused: one or more `ambiguous` / `not-re-anchorable` annotations.
Only RA1-RA3 (the mechanical re-anchor contract) are hard; W1/W2 are advisory (a vanished anchor is a
candidate, not proof — the writer may have reworded) — the regression-diff posture. Prints to stdout; a
human-readable re-anchoring report is orchestrator-written.

Round-trip GLUE (the workflow, not just the gate). `reanchor` validates the re-anchor in memory; the
revision loop also needs the revision-aware marked-up copy ON DISK and the cross-round join:
  emit      re-anchor draft N's notes onto N+1 and WRITE the re-anchored manifest + the rendered annotated
            copy of the revised draft (held/moved only; re-gated RA1-RA3 before any write).
  crossref  join this round-trip's anchor-level classes against regression-diff's finding-level classes
            BY finding_id (the orchestrator join the spec reserves — anchor x finding corroboration).

Usage:
  reanchor.py reanchor <prior_run_folder> <new_snapshot> [--strict]
  reanchor.py emit     <prior_run_folder> <new_snapshot> [-o <out_dir>]
  reanchor.py crossref <prior_run_folder> <new_snapshot> <this_run_folder> [--strict]
  reanchor.py --self-test
Exit: 0 clean / WARN-only, 1 ERROR (or WARN under --strict), 2 usage.
