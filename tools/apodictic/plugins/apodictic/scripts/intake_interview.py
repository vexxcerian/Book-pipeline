"""intake-interview — structural integrity for the Uncertainty-Resolution Intake Interview.

`validate.sh intake-interview <run_folder|files>` shells out here. APODICTIC already opens with a
substantial draft-then-validate intake (genre, controlling idea, reader promise, comps) and Shelf &
Positioning captures the intended shelf. What no existing surface does is resolve a SPECIFIC
structural ambiguity the framework detected but cannot settle from the text — "is the non-linear
ordering in Ch 4-6 a deliberate braid, or drift?". This interview asks the only person who knows:
the author. Each query is an apodictic.intake_query.v1 block; this validator owns the contract.

The discipline is *defer, don't duplicate, and calibrate, never suppress*: every question is a flavor
of intentional-vs-accidental (the closed `kind` enum has no contract value), and an answer may direct
HOW a feature is assessed but may never pre-empt whether a finding is raised (the Deficit-Lock guard).

  I1 schema            an intake_query block fails its schema (bad kind/confidence enum, malformed
                       IQ-NN id, missing current_inference/question, broken JSON, duplicate id).
  I2 no contract dup   a `question` re-asks a contract element owned by the intake / Shelf (heuristic
                       blocklist: "what genre", "controlling idea", "reader promise", "who is this
                       for"). Advisory; ERROR under --strict. The closed `kind` enum is the structural
                       guard; this catches a leak smuggled into a question's wording. Override (per
                       id): <!-- override: intake-dup IQ-NN — <rationale> -->.
  I3 grounded          a query grounded in NEITHER a resolving `ambiguity_ref` (a real finding id in
                       the Ledger) NOR a non-empty `source_note` is manufactured (ERROR). A query that
                       states an `ambiguity_ref` which does not resolve is a dangling reference (ERROR).
  I4 calibrate-not-    `treat_as_intended` contains suppression phrasing ("suppress", "drop/skip the
     suppress          flag", "don't raise", "remove the finding"). It directs assessment; it does not
                       pre-empt a verdict. ERROR by default — it guards severity honesty.
  W1 coverage          a Pass-0/1 LOW/UNCERTAIN finding (id `F-P0-…`/`F-P1-…`) or an
                       `### Unresolved Questions` bullet that only the author could resolve has no
                       query. Advisory; ERROR under --strict. (At the after-Pass-0/1 checkpoint only
                       Pass-0/1 findings exist; later-pass findings are out of W1's scope.)

The interview file (intake_query blocks) is read together with the Findings Ledger it references
(finding blocks + the `### Unresolved Questions` section). Each is optional; an empty/absent interview
is a no-op. Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine). See
docs/uncertainty-intake-interview.md.

    [...] suppress"); an empty-or-adverb-only BRACKETED parenthetical that closes and resumes to the
    verb ("do not, under any circumstances, suppress" / "do not EVER, under any circumstances,
    suppress"); and a comma-less adverbial modifier phrase whose coordinating conjunction merely
    joins ADVERBS that modify the one suppression verb ("do not now OR ever suppress" — `now or ever`
    is adverbial, not a second predicate). Cases that are NOT exempt (the suppression is an
    un-negated directive and must fire): a FRONTED phrase, verbal OR adverbial, that runs straight

    joins a fresh PREDICATE ("do not exaggerate BUT suppress" / "never overstate severity AND
    suppress") — there a verb sits before the conjunction, so the head is not adverbial.

    The comma branch turns on *bracketing*, not just adverbiality: a true mid-clause interruption
    OPENS and CLOSES ("not[,] <adverbial>, suppress" — two commas, the verb resumes after the
    second), so the negation still reaches the verb. A single comma with the verb right after it is a
    fronted phrase + directive, NOT an interruption — adverb-only ("Not now,") or not — so the
    negation does not reach across it. Multiple interruptions must ALL be modifiers: a predicate after
    a valid parenthetical ("not, in any case, calibrate carefully, suppress") still fires. (Prior
    passes: "any non-empty pre-comma material fires" wrongly fired on an adverb before a parenthetical
    — Codex P2; "any comma-less conjunction fires" wrongly fired on a coordinated adverbial — Codex
    P2; "adverb-only pre-comma always scopes" wrongly EXEMPTED a fronted adverbial directive `Not now,
    suppress` — Codex P2; checking only the FIRST enclosed segment wrongly EXEMPTED a predicate after a
    valid parenthetical `not, in any case, calibrate carefully, suppress` — Codex P1.)

    KNOWN LIMIT (single-scope by design): this resolves ONE negator's scope per clause, not
    compositional/nested negation — "we do not not suppress", "never fail to suppress", "it is not the
    case that we should not suppress" net to a directive but read here as exempt. Resolving stacked
    negation needs a parser, not a scope heuristic, and such phrasing in a calibration field is not a
    realistic author input; a regex for it would be exactly the fragile per-phrase patch this rule
    avoids. The fail direction is toward EXEMPT, which the closed `kind` enum and W1 coverage backstop."""
