"""scene-ethics — structural integrity for the Scene-Ethics Plan (Nonfiction Pre-Draft, Increment 4).

`validate.sh scene-ethics <run_folder|files>` shells out here. For narrative nonfiction / memoir that
depicts identifiable real people, the writer plans — before drafting — how each depiction will be
handled ethically: consent status, the handling decision (as-is / anonymize / composite / seek
consent / omit), and the fairness reasoning. Each is an apodictic.scene_ethics.v1 block. This is the
writer's ETHICAL plan, kept distinct from the Legal Risk Register (which owns LEGAL exposure); the
two cross-reference via an optional `legal_ref`. This validator owns the ethics-plan contract and
surfaces unresolved depictions.

  E1 invalid item     a scene_ethics block fails its schema (bad consent_status / handling enum,
                      malformed EP-NN id or legal_ref, missing required field, broken JSON).
  E2 duplicate id     two items share an EP-NN id.
  W1 unresolved depiction  handling=as-is AND consent not yet OBTAINED (not-sought OR sought-pending)
                      AND no fairness_check — an identifiable person depicted as-is with neither
                      consent in hand nor a fairness rationale (pending consent can still be refused,
                      with no fallback) (advisory; ERROR --strict). The signature ethics check.
                      Override (per id): <!-- override: scene-ethics-unresolved EP-NN — <rationale> -->.
  W2 no legal cross-check  an as-is depiction of an identifiable person (consent not not-applicable)
                      with no legal_ref — check it against the Legal Risk Register (advisory; ERROR
                      --strict). Realizes the ethics<->legal cross-reference.

The Firewall holds: the writer makes the ethical decisions; this surfaces what needs one. It is not
ethical adjudication and not legal advice (the Legal Risk Register owns legal exposure). Reuses
apodictic_artifacts. An artifact with no scene_ethics block is a no-op. See docs/nonfiction-pre-draft.md.
