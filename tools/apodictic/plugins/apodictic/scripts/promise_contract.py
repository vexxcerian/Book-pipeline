"""promise-contract — Promise-Contract Fidelity: does the pitch keep the promise the book makes?

`validate.sh promise-contract <run_folder|files>` shells out here. APODICTIC's foundational move is
contract inference; this module points it at the author's own marketing COPY. It diagnoses the gap
between the persisted pitch (query / synopsis / blurb / logline) and the inferred Contract — emphasis
distortion, reveal leak, over/under-promise, cross-document inconsistency — and never drafts the
replacement copy (the Firewall: diagnose the copy, never write it). It CONSUMES Shelf & Positioning
(genre / comp / tone) rather than re-deriving it; this module owns only the document-fidelity layer.

Findings are apodictic.finding.v1 blocks with origin PCF (id F-PCF-NN). Each PCF flag is a two-sided
GAP, so it must cite both sides via a namespaced evidence-ref convention scoped to PCF findings:
  copy:<copy_type>¶<n>   a span in the persisted pitch copy (e.g. copy:query¶2)
  contract:<FIELD>       a Contract field (e.g. contract:CONTROLLING IDEA, contract:READER PROMISE)
  ms:<locus>             a manuscript locus (e.g. ms:Ch 9)
The persisted pitch copy is apodictic.pitch_copy.v1 (a first-class durable input, NOT a runtime
paste); persisting it is what makes the firewall guard (W1) a substring check and the form gate (P3)
mechanical.

  P1 two-sided gap     every F-PCF-NN finding carries >=1 copy: ref AND >=1 contract:/ms: ref. A
                       one-sided "gap" is an unsupported assertion — the signature integrity check.
  P2 copy persisted    an apodictic.pitch_copy.v1 input exists and every document declares a valid
                       & typed       copy_type. Flags are form-calibrated; an undeclared/absent copy makes
                       PCF2/PCF5 ungovernable.
  P3 reveal-leak       a PCF2 finding's copy: ref must NOT point at a synopsis. A synopsis discloses
                       form gate     by design, so a PCF2 raised against one is a calibration error and fails.
  W1 drafted-copy      a multi-sentence quoted block in the report that is NOT a verbatim substring
                       leak (firewall)  of the persisted pitch copy => authored replacement copy (the Firewall
                       leak). Concrete substring check, not a vibe heuristic. Advisory; ERROR --strict.
                       Override (per id): <!-- override: drafted-copy PCF-NN — <rationale> -->.
  W2 market-prediction a PCF finding matching the prohibited sales-prediction phrase set ("won't
                       drift (#14)      sell", "agents will pass", "no market for", "unmarketable", "won't find
                       an audience"). Keeps the module on the fidelity side of the §Not Planned line.
                       Advisory; ERROR --strict. Override: <!-- override: market-prediction PCF-NN — … -->.

severity is the editorial Must/Should/Could scale, where severity = fidelity risk (how badly promise
and book diverge), never market outcome. Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine).
Each artifact is optional; an empty/absent one is a no-op. See docs/promise-contract-audit.md.
