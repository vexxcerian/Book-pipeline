"""lifecycle-node — derive a project's lifecycle node from its sidecar (Project Addressability, Increment 3).

`validate.sh lifecycle-node <sidecar> [run_folder]` shells out here. State-driven dispatch needs one
authoritative, *tested* answer to "where is this project?" so `/start`, `/projects`, and the Increment-4
loop dispatcher don't each re-derive it in prose. This computes the node by a single precedence
(FIRST MATCH WINS) over the existing Diagnostic_State.meta.json sidecar — no new stored state:

    cold -> blocked_gate -> execution -> pre_writing -> submission -> revising -> diagnosed -> diagnosing

The set is TOTAL: any readable sidecar resolves to exactly one node, with `diagnosing` the catch-all
default (intake done, passes/synthesis in progress, no editorial letter yet — the case that matched no
node in the first draft). Each node's signal:

  cold          no sidecar / unreadable (no bound project)
  blocked_gate  execution.pending_gate present (resolve the gate first)
  execution     mode == "execution"
  pre_writing   next_action.key == "pre_writing" (pre-writing minimal sidecar)
  submission    readiness[] non-empty (a submission-readiness assessment was recorded)
  revising      revision_progress.steps_complete > 0
  diagnosed     a synthesis/editorial letter exists: {project_root}/SYNTHESIS.md or
                {project_root}/runs/*/*_Synthesis_*.md (project_root = the sidecar's dir; an optional
                run_folder arg is an extra search location)
  diagnosing    default — mode == "diagnostic" and nothing above matched

`diagnosed` is the only node needing a filesystem check; when no synthesis is found anywhere,
derivation falls through to `diagnosing` (the safe pre-letter default). Reads the sidecar directly
(stdlib JSON). See docs/project-addressability.md.

  lifecycle_node.py lifecycle-node <sidecar> [run_folder]
  lifecycle_node.py --self-test

Exit: 0 (prints the node), 2 usage. (Pure derivation — there is no failure verdict; an unreadable
sidecar is reported as `cold`, exit 0.)
