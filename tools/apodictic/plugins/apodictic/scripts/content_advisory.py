"""content-advisory — structural integrity for the Content-Advisory / Sensitivity-Surface Derivation.

`validate.sh content-advisory <run_folder|files>` shells out here. A writer preparing to publish often
needs a content advisory — a map of where the manuscript depicts intense material (violence, sexual
content, self-harm, abuse), at what intensity, on- or off-page — for front-matter, marketing metadata,
sensitivity-reader handoff, or their own awareness. APODICTIC's existing audits *assess* such content
for craft/harm; none DERIVES a reader/marketing-facing advisory artifact. This is that derivation:
pure extraction over depicted content, anchored to loci. Each note is an apodictic.content_note.v1
block; this validator owns the advisory's contract.

It is OPT-IN by design (some authors decline content warnings on principle), and DESCRIPTIVE, never
evaluative: a note records *that* content is depicted and at what intensity ("on-page graphic
violence — Ch 7"); it never calls it gratuitous or recommends cutting it. A content note is NOT a
defect — no Must/Should/Could severity; its intensity scale is orthogonal to the editorial scale.

  A1 schema           a content_note block fails its schema (bad category/intensity/depiction enum,
                      malformed CN-NN id, missing field, empty/non-string loci, broken JSON, dup id),
                      OR category=='other' with an empty `label` (a conditional the schema can't express).
  A2 locus shape      a note carries a locus that is empty or not a coarse locus (no chapter / §section
                      / ¶ / line / page token). A precondition, NOT a firewall proof — resolution is
                      deferred to the shared snapshot layer.
  A3 severity leak    the advisory's reader-facing prose or any note `label` carries an editorial
                      Must/Should/Could-Fix token, OR an apodictic:finding block is present in the
                      artifact. Content notes are advisories, not findings (the Legal-Risk orthogonal-
                      severity discipline). ERROR.
  W1 prescriptive     a note label or the advisory prose matches a PRESCRIPTIVE construction
     drift            ("should/recommend/consider … cut/remove/soften/tone down/reduce") — not bare
                      adjectives like "excessive" which legitimately describe depicted content. The
                      advisory describes; it does not prescribe. Advisory; ERROR under --strict.
                      Override a note LABEL (per id): <!-- override: advisory-eval CN-NN — <why> -->.
                      Override the reader-facing PROSE (id-less, so a per-id override never silences
                      unrelated prose): <!-- override: advisory-eval-prose — <why> -->.
  W2 opt-in marker    a resolved advisory artifact lacks the `<!-- content-advisory: opted-in -->`
                      marker (generated only on request). Advisory; ERROR under --strict.

Reuses apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine). The artifact is optional; if none is
resolved the command no-ops with exit 2 ("no advisory artifact"), like legal-risk. See
docs/content-advisory.md.
