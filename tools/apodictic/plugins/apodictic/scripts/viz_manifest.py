"""manuscript-viz — manifest<->source provenance for Manuscript-Structure Visualizations.

`validate.sh manuscript-viz <run_folder|files...> [--strict]` shells out here. A finished
development edit already CONTAINS most of the numbers a structural picture needs — locked inside
prose and tables. This builds no new analysis: a `apodictic.viz_manifest.v1` block holds only
TRACEABLE data copied verbatim from two already-machine-readable sources — the Timeline Event-Ledger
pipe-table (scenes) and the `apodictic.finding.v1` blocks (findings) — and a render-only SVG layer
draws it. The validator owns manifest<->source provenance:

  E1 manifest schema     the block parses + satisfies the wrapper schema, every scenes[]/findings[]
                         element is a well-formed object with ONLY allowlisted keys (a visual-style
                         field is itself a failure — style is the renderer's, not the run's).
  E2 provenance closure  every findings[].id resolves to a real finding in the Ledger; every
                         scenes[].scene_id resolves to a Timeline Event-Ledger row; every
                         findings[].chapter equals the conservative `evidence_refs` parse (Chapter N /
                         Ch N -> "Ch N", else the literal "unplaced"). No guessed placement.
  E3 Must-Fix complete   every body Must-Fix finding in the Ledger appears in findings[].
  E4 no orphan data      every scenes[] cell is byte-equal to the Timeline cell; every findings[]
                         severity/confidence is byte-equal to its source block. The manifest copied,
                         it did not compute or embellish.
  E5 no duplicate entry  a scene_id or finding id appears at most once — a repeat double-draws a bar
                         (a value the sources did not contain); the per-id E2/E4 checks pass on dups.
  W2 scene order         scenes[] order diverges from the Timeline's document order (the pacing
                         curve's x-axis is scene order — a reordered manifest draws a false shape).
                         Advisory.
  W1 coverage            a Timeline row not represented in scenes[] (silent under-render). Advisory.

Manuscript-Visualization Completion (charts 4-7) extends this same manifest<->source contract. Two
render deliverables exist today: chart 7-nonfiction — the CLAIM LADDER over apodictic.argument_spine.v1
(C0 thesis + C1..Cn subclaims) annotated with support coverage from apodictic.support_plan.v1 — and
chart 5 — the CHARACTER CO-PRESENCE NETWORK over the apodictic.scene_roster.v1 producer (per-scene
cast; the Timeline carries POV only, not a full roster). The manifest gains four OPTIONAL, additive
arrays (co_presence / scene_functions / reveal_points / claim_ladder); claim_ladder + co_presence are
rendered (the other two are still producer-gated — their producers do not exist yet, so their arrays
stay absent and the gates skip them):

  X1 new-array schema    each present co_presence/scene_functions/reveal_points/claim_ladder element
                         is a well-formed object with ONLY its allowlisted keys (a visual-style key
                         is itself a failure; a scene_ids/scene_id/section key on a claim_ladder[]
                         object is itself a failure — the claim-to-scene map has no producer and
                         cannot be smuggled in). claim_ladder[].support[] items admit only
                         {support_type, status} (the support_plan.v1 enums); co_presence[].characters
                         items are bare canonical NAME STRINGS (the auditable {name, anchor} richness
                         lives in the scene_roster.v1 PRODUCER, not the manifest).
  X5 claim-ladder prov   every claim_ladder[].claim_id is a member of
                         argument_spine.spine_subclaim_ids(spine) (REUSE that parser — no second
                         one); label is byte-equal to the matching subclaim string with its leading
                         "Cn:"/"Cn " token stripped; each support[] item is byte-equal to a real
                         support_plan.v1 block whose subclaim_id == claim_id; an empty support[] is
                         permitted ONLY when no support_plan declares that claim_id (bare assertion,
                         the W2 condition argument_spine.py already computes). No scene resolution.
  X6 no orphan datum     generalizes E4 to the new arrays — every value byte-equals its producer
                         source (a claim_ladder[] label not byte-equal to its stripped subclaim, or a
                         support pairing absent from support_plan.v1, fails here).
  X7 no duplicate        generalizes E5 — a scene_id at most once per new array; a claim_id at most
                         once in claim_ladder[].
  X2 co-presence prov    every co_presence[].scene_id matches a scene_roster.v1 roster entry AND
                         resolves to a Timeline Event-Ledger row; every name in
                         co_presence[].characters is in that scene's roster (canonical) names; the
                         scene's Timeline POV character is present in its roster (cross-check); and in
                         the producer, every roster character's `anchor` is non-empty. The
                         present-vs-mentioned READING is producer/author-enforced (a validator cannot
                         read prose) — the gate enforces anchor-non-empty + provenance closure, NOT
                         the semantic reading (the Continuity Bible C2 author-enforced precedent).
  X8 producer-present    if a new array is PRESENT, its producer MUST be present and resolvable (for
                         claim_ladder: a resolvable argument_spine.v1 block, plus the support_plan.v1
                         blocks for any non-empty support[]; for co_presence: a resolvable
                         scene_roster.v1 block). Absent array -> skipped, not failed.
  W3 chart coverage      a producer artifact is present but its corresponding array is empty/absent
                         (silent under-rendering). Advisory, ERROR under --strict.

(X3/X4 — scene-function / tension provenance — are reserved for the still-producer-gated charts 6/4;
their producers do not exist yet, so those gates are not implemented. X2 now backs chart 5 — its
scene_roster.v1 producer DOES exist.)

The severity->encoding map is HARDCODED in the renderer, never read from the manifest, so a run
cannot recolor a Must-Fix to comfort, and a Must-Fix marker is always drawn at full salience (its
size never shrinks for low confidence). Reuses timeline_checks._parse_event_ledger (the Timeline
column parser), apodictic_artifacts (block grammar + schema engine), and — for the claim ladder —
argument_spine.parse_spine / parse_support_plans / spine_subclaim_ids (no second parser). See
docs/manuscript-visualizations.md.
