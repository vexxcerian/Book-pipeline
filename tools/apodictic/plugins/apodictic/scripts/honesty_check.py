"""APODICTIC honesty gate (Phase 4): Deficit Lock + Softness Gate.

Closes the uniform-charity / silent-softening leak — a letter that under-delivers
a finding it already locked at Triage, while still passing severity-floor and
audit-signal-propagation.

  softness-check <editorial_letter> <findings_ledger>
      Compare the delivered letter against the Triage-locked findings
      (apodictic.finding.v1 blocks in the ledger). For each locked
      Must-Fix/Should-Fix: when the finding carries a Lifecycle ID, match it to the
      letter by ID (exact) — both the body delivery and the Severity Calibration
      record reference the ID; otherwise fall back to evidence-ref / mechanism
      heuristics. ERROR on a recorded downgrade, a finding buried (absent from the
      author-facing body), or a finding dropped (absent from both), unless a body
      override marker is present. Hedged delivery -> WARN. Weak-axis coherence is
      owned by `severity-floor`, not here.

  deficit-lock <findings_ledger>
      Verify EVERY synthesis-bound (Must-Fix/Should-Fix) finding was locked
      structurally: more prose severity labels than apodictic.finding.v1 blocks
      means a finding was left unlocked -> ERROR.

  --self-test     built-in cases (both checks)

Block grammar + severity ordering come from the shared `apodictic_artifacts`
module (schemas/ are the source of truth). The body override marker is
ID-SCOPED: `<!-- override: softness-downgrade F-<ORIGIN>-<NN> — <rationale> -->`
(body-only; appendix markers are non-canonical). It downgrades ERROR→WARN ONLY
for the named Finding Lifecycle ID — a BARE marker with no resolvable ID
acknowledges nothing (so one marker cannot blanket-mask every locked finding's
downgrade; the gate-bypass closed 2026-06-20). Markers inside code spans
(backticks) are ignored. There is intentionally no blanket/all-findings form.

Exit: 0 pass (no ERROR), 1 ERROR(s), 2 usage error.
